ASSIGNMENT 3: Comparative & Non-Atomic Requirement Analysis
================================================================================
Gemini Suggestions: Enabled


COMPARATIVES DETECTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Sentence: It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.
   Keyword: better
   === Gemini Suggestion ===
   IMPROVED: The system shall display assigned cases, active alerts, and pending tasks, enabling police personnel to prioritize their daily workload and initiate action on 95% of critical alerts within 15 minutes of system notification.

EXPLANATION: This version replaces vague comparatives ("better," "greater efficiency") with specific, quantifiable outcomes. It establishes clear metrics for both planning (prioritization) and execution (timely action on alerts), making the requirement directly verifiable during testing.
   ==========================

   Original: It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency.
   Suggestion: Replace vague terms with measurable criteria, e.g.,
    - 'shall respond within 2 seconds'
    - 'shall process 1000 transactions per second'

2. Sentence: This requirement is intended to allow for cases where cases used infrequently are stored on slower media than more active records.
   Keyword: slower
   === Gemini Suggestion ===
   IMPROVED: The system shall implement data tiering such that records with a last access timestamp older than a configurable threshold (e.g., 30 days) are stored on a secondary storage tier. This secondary tier shall provide an average read latency at least 200% higher than the primary storage tier used for active records.

EXPLANATION: This rewrite defines "infrequently used" by a measurable timestamp threshold and quantifies "slower media" using a specific, relative average read latency percentage, making the requirement clear and testable.
