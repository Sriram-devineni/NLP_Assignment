Introduction 
This se
ction introduc
es the System Req
uirements Specification (SRS) for Project
 
ZNI
X to its 
readers. 
1.1
 
Purpose 
The 
pur
pos
e of this software requirements
 specification
 (SRS) is to establish the 
major req
uirements of
 the Project
 ZNI
X research and devel
opment
 effort. 
Project  ZNIX  is  an  
attemp
t  to  refine
  tradition

1.2
 
Scope 
The SRS a
ppli
es to the higher level
 de
sign of the ZNI
X Framewor
k. 
1.3
 
Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations 
This  s
ection  provi
des  the  definitions  
of  
all  terms,  acro
nyms,  and
  ab
breviatio

requ
ired
  to  p
roperly  interp

Not

ocument to
 distingu
ish ZNIX-specific terms. 
1.3.

ZNI
X  is  not  an  acro
nym.  
The  term  was  decid
ed  upo
n  to
  suggest  the  asp
irant  
notion that
 a fu

 could be the last (th

  th

and  
Framew

woul
d be used interch

1.3.

Client Process 
A   client   
proc
ess   i
s   a   softwa
re   applica
tion   that   interacts   with   the   
ZNI
X   
Framew
ork  by  either
  utilizing  
the  publi
c  API
  or  by  directly  
accessing  
the  
information  presente
d  by  the  
Framewor
k.  Note  that  
all  client  a
ppli
cation  
nee
d 
not
  be  “Z
NIX-aware”  (i.e.  knows  
that  the  information  i
t  acces
ses  
are  manag
ed  
by  the  Fra
mewor
k).  As  l
ong  as
  its  oper
ation  involves  an  intervention  
by  the  
Framew
ork at some point, an applicati
on may b
e co
nsid
ered
 a ZNIX Client. 
1.3.

ZN
IX Proxy Mech
anism 
The  
Proxy  
Mech
anis
m  is  the  c
ollecti
on  of
  Framew
ork  c
ompone
nts  that  enabl
e  
“ZNI
X-unaware” appli
cations to 
utilize the Framew
ork capabilities. 
1.3.
5
 
Entity 
An  Entity  is  the  
basic  
bloc
k  
that  buil
ds  up  Z
NIX’s  inform
ation  hierar
chy.
  
Entities  are  first  class  citizens  of  the  ZNI
X  Framew
ork;  which
  simply  m
eans  
that the 
Identity o
f an Entity is u
niqu
e and
 non-d
ependant o
n any o
ther Ent
ity.  
1.3.
6
 
Asso
ciate 
An  Associate  is  similar  to
  an  Entity,  d
iffering  in  the  fact  that  its  
Identity  is  
dependant
  on  at  least  o
ne  Ent
ity.  T
he  Framew
ork’s
  interest  in  an  Ass
ociate  
depen
ds  solely  
on  its  relationsh
ip(s)  t
o  first  class  citizens.  As  su
ch,  when  the  
last relate
d Entity bre
aks the rel
ationshi
p to an
 Ass
ociated (i.e. l
oses intere
st in 
it),  it  will  
be  removed  from  the  ZNI
X  data
1
  store  a
s  it  no  longer  has  any
  
significanc
e in the context. 
                                        
 
 
1
 Note the use of t
he 
word 
“data
” when it has been s
tated that t
he 
wo
rd “inform
ation” i
s preferr
ed in this context. The 
thinking
 behind
 
this is that, what 
the frame
work m
anages is ra
w da
ta; it 
will a
ssociat
e a meaning
 to t
his data effectively
 transfo
rming t
hem in
to 
information.

In ZNIX te

y the 
word 
“Inf

ways prefe

over
 the 
word 
“data

plies that there is an 
associated “meaning”.
