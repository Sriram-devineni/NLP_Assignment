DigitalHome Requirements Specification 
1.    Introduction 
This document specifies the requirements for the de
velopment of a “Smart 
House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHome
Owner Division of 
HomeOwner Inc. A “Smart House” is a home management
 system that allows 
home residents to easily manage their daily lives b
y providing for a lifestyle that 
brings together security, environmental and energy 
management (temperature, 
humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communic
ations. The Smart House 
components consist of household devices (e.g., a he
ating and air conditioning 
unit, a security system, and small appliances and l
ighting units, etc.), sensors 
and controllers for the devices, communication link
s between the components, 
and a computer system, which will manage the compon
ents. 
 
The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification
 (SRS) is based on the 
DigitalHome Customer Need Statement
. It is made up of a list of the principal 
features of the system. This initial version of Dig
italHome will be a limited 
prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner 
management to make 
business decisions about the future commercial deve
lopment of 
DigitalHomeOwner products and services. Hence, the 
SRS is not intended as a 
comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalH
ome requirements. There is 
a supplementary document that provides additional d
etail and information about 
the 
DigitalHome
 requirements: the 
Digital Home Use Case Model
 [HO2010]. 
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwne
r Division, in 
consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwn
er Inc.

3.    Overall description 
3.1 
Product Description and Scope 
The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this d
ocument, is a system that will 
allow a home user to manage devices that control th
e environment of a home. 
The user communicates through a personal web page o
n the DigitalHome web 
server or on a local home server. The DH web server
 communicates, through a 
home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and c
ontroller devices in the 
home.  
 
The product is based on the 
Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition
 
[HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will 
allow business decisions to 
be made about future development of a commercial pr
oduct. The scope of the 
project will be limited to the management of device
s which control temperature, 
humidity, security, and power to small appliances a
nd lighting units, through the 
use of a web-ready device. The prototype DH softwar
e system will be situated in 
a simulated environment. There will be no actual ph
ysical home and all sensors 
and controllers will be simulated. 
 
3.2 
Users Description 
3.2.1   DigitalHome Users 
3.2.1.1 
The general user shall be able to use the D
H system 
capabilities to monitor and control the environment
 in his/her 
home. 
3.2.1.2 
The general user is familiar with the layou
t of his/her home and 
the location of sensor and control devices (for tem
perature, for 
humidity, and for power to small appliances and lig
hting units). 
3.2.1.3 
Although the general user is not familiar w
ith the technical 
features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with 
the use of a 
web interface and can perform simple web operations
 (logging 
in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitt
ing 
information and requests via a web interface).  
3.2.1.4 
A Master user will be designated, who shall
 be able to change 
the configuration of the system. For example, a Mas
ter User 
shall be able to add a user account or change the d
efault 
parameter settings. He/she will have the same right
 as the DH 
Technician, described in section 3.2.2.4. 
3.2.2   DigitalHome Technician 


Digital Home Project, SRS 1.3 
Page 6 
 
3.2.2.1 
A DH Technician is responsible for setting 
up and maintaining 
the configuration of a DH system. 
3.2.2.2 
A DH Technician has experience with the typ
e of hardware, 
software, and web services associated with a system
 like the 
DH system. 
3.2.2.3 
A DH Technician is specially trained by Dig
italHomeOwner to be 
familiar with the functionality, architecture, and 
operation of the 
DH system product.  
3.2.2.4 
A DH Technician will have rights beyond the
 DH General User, 
capable of setting up and making changes in the con
figuration 
of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and e
stablishing 
user accounts), and starting and stopping operation
 of the DH 
System. 
3.3 
Development Constraints 
3.3.1   The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome Sy
stem (as specified in this 
document) must be completed within twelve months of
 inception. 
3.3.2   The development team will consist of five eng
ineers. The 
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management a
nd 
communication support. 
3.3.3   The development team will use the development
 process specified by 
the Digital HomeOwner Inc. 
3.3.4   Where possible, the DigitalHome project will 
employ widely used, 
accepted, and available hardware and software techn
ology and 
standards, both for product elements and for develo
pment tools. See 
section 3.4 for additional detail. 
3.3.5   Because of potential market competition for D
igitalHome products, the 
cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers,
 server, tools, etc.), 
for this project should be minimized. As part of th
e final project report 
the development team will describe their efforts to
 minimize costs, 
including price comparisons between DH elements and
 
comparable/competitive elements. 
3.3.6   The DH system will be tested in a simulated e
nvironment. There will be 
no actual physical home and all sensors and control
lers will be 
simulated. However, the simulated environment will 
be realistic and 
adhere to the physical properties and constraints o
f an actual home 
and to real sensors and controllers. 
3.3.7   Major changes to this document (e.g., changes
 in requirements) must 
be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner
 Division. 
3.4 
Operational Environment 
Although the system to be developed is a “proof of 
concept” system intended to 
help Homeowner Inc. to make marketing and developme
nt decisions, the 
following sections describe operational environment
 concerns and constraints; 


Digital Home Project, SRS 1.3

switching heating or cooling devices on or off as n
eeded) to 
achieve the set point temperature.  
c.   The sensor part of the thermostat has a sensitiv
ity range 
between 14ºF and 104ºF (-10ºC and 40ºC).

set up. 
5.2.2.2 
If the DH System fails (due to power loss, 
loss of internet 
access, or other software or hardware failure), the

exception handling so that 
the system responds to a user with a clear, descrip
tive message when 
an error or an exceptional condition occurs. 
5.3 
Safety Requirements 
5.3.1   Although there are no specific safety require
ments, high system 
reliability is important to insure there are no sys
tem failures in carrying 
out user requests. Such failures might affect the s
afety of home 
dwellers (e.g., security breaches, inadequate light
ing in dark spaces, 
inappropriate temperature and humidity for people w
ho are in ill-health, 
or powering certain appliances when young children 
are present). 
5.4 
Security Requirements 
5.4.1   Upon installation, a DigitalHome user account
 shall be established. 
The DigitalHome web system shall provide for authen
tication and 
information encryption through a recognized reliabl
e and effective 
security technology, such as Transport Layer Securi
ty. 
5.4.2   Log in to an account shall require entry of a

password. 
5.5 
Maintenance Requirements 
5.5.1   The development of the DH system shall use me
thods and techniques 
such as the following to support system maintenance
:  
5.5.1.1 
Documentation of requirements, design, and 
code 
5.5.1.2 
Use of abstraction, information hiding and 
module 
independence in system design; and 
5.5.1.3 
Use of IEEE standards [IEEE830, IEEE1008, I
EEE1016, 
IEEE1028] and the 
HomeOwner Coding Standard
 [HO4710]. 
5.5.2   Although the product produced under this docu
ment will be a 
“prototype” version, all modules and components of 
this prototype 
version shall be designed and implemented in such a
 manner that it 
may be incorporated in a fully specified commercial
 version of the 
DigitalHome System. 
5.6 
Business Rules 
5.6.1   All system documents (Software Requirements S
pecification, 
Architectural Design Specification, Module Detailed
 Design, Module 
Source Code, and all Test Plans) shall be up-to-dat
e, use the 
Homeowner document format [HO2305] and reside in th
e HomeOwner 
Document Archive at completion of the project. 
5.6.2   HomeOwner has designated object-oriented deve
lopment, using UML
