Functional Requirements Specification v1

Introduction 
This  report  
documents  the  functional  re
quirements  specification  (FRS)  
for  the
  
nex
t  genera
tion  of  th
e  Pontis  Bridge  Manage
ment  Sys
tem  (BMS),  referred  to  a
s  
Pontis   5
.0   
throughout.      These
   in
clud
e   the   functional   re
quirements,   which   
describe  the  operations  tha
t  user
s  must  per
form  using  Pontis  
5.0,
  the  
non-
functional  req
uirements
,  which  des
cribe
  the  manner  in  wh
ich  the  soft
ware  will  
be  designed,  developed,  and  dep
loyed,  and  
the  plan  fo
r  implementation  of  
Pontis 5.
0. 
Throughout
  this  document,  the  terms  “s
hall”  and  
“will”  are  used  
to  identify  
specific  f
unctions  and  
capabilit
ies  that  
Pontis  5.0  must  
provide  (e.g.,  Pontis  
inspection  interface  shall  provide  the  
ability  to  perform  data  validation  on  
National  Bridge  Invento
ry  items).    
The  terms  “
may”  a
nd  “
might”  are  
used  to
  
indicate  functions  and  c
apabilities  that  ma
y  or  
may  not  be  
included  in  
the  final  
product  (e.g.,  Pontis  may  provide  a
  dire
ct  link  
to  GIS  soft
ware  for  map-based
  
query
ing).    The  status  
of  these  items  
will  be  resolved  thr
ough  future  detailed  
software   d
esign   activity   or   thro
ug
h   progre
ss   by   other   vendors   in   the   
development and deplo
yment of Po
ntis add-in a
pplications. 
Note  that  t
his  docume
nt  is  not  intended  to  describe  the  
architecture
  or  data  
model  of  Pontis  5.0,  nor  is  it  
intended  to  describe  the  specific
  d
esign  or  
implementa
tion  plan  f
or  any  fun
ctional  
requirement.    This  information  wil
l  
appear in later Pontis 5.

Preliminary work has been
 
performed  to  outline  the  technical  archit
ecture  for  Pontis  5.0,  a
nd  a  
Technical  
Architecture  Description
  (TAD)  was  developed  
in  2003.
1
    The  TAD  pres
ents  
a  
future  vision  for  the
  project,  emphas
izing  
a  web  application,  an
  advanced  
database architecture, m
aximum 
reuse of 
user reports and forms, and a flex
ible, 
extensible user interface. 
This  docum
ent,  once  a
pproved  
in  
final
  form,  indicates  agreement  bet
ween  the
  
AASHTO  P
ontis  Task  Force,  on  
behalf  of  the  Pontis  licensing  agenc
ies,  and  
Cambridge Systematics, on the spec
ific fu
nct
ions and capabilities that Pontis 5.0 
must  provide,  providing  a  clear  a
nd  specif
ic  
scope  of  services  for  th
e  software
  
design  and
  development  effort.    
Any  su
bsequent  changes  to  the  functional  
requ
irements  must  be  
careful
ly  review
ed  and
  considered,  because  t
hey  may  
impact  the  
project  schedule  and/or  or  ex
pand  the
  scope  
of  work  beyond  th
at  
which is covered by the design and 
de
velopment contract between AASHTO and 
the software developer.

his approach w
as identified  in  previous  discussions
  
and documents.

  Some sections of th
is template 
do not apply to Pontis 
5.0, a
nd 
have therefore been marked as such 
in the 
text of this report,
 or om
itted in their 
entirety.   
The TAD provides a general ar
chitecture fo
r the future 
versi
on of Pontis.  It does 
not elaborat
e requirements for t
he new system
 in detail, 
although it does identify
 
key stake
holders and st
akeholder concerns to be considered in the future Pontis
 
version.    A  specific  re
quirements  gatherin
g  eff

Pontis  5.0  
must  address  this  objective  e
xplicitly  and  m
ust  be  sign
ificantly
  
improved o
ver c
urrent 
version(s). 
Flexible,
  customizable
  means
  that  the  
applicat
ion  
provides  inna
te  me
chanisms
  
for  ex
tendin
g  and  adapting  the  dat
abase
  sche
ma,  foundation  capabilities,  and
  
user  presentation  elements  
such  as  fo
rms  and  reports.    
This  has  been  a  
key  
benefit of the existing product.  The futu
re Pontis 5.0 product should be capable 
of  adapting
  to  changes
  in  data  req
uirements,
  reporting,  
standards
,  and  other  
influencing factors. 
Preservation  of  agency
  investment
s  
means
  th
at  the
  significant  body  of
  effort  to  
develop  staff  expertise,  
data,  reports,  da
ta  form
s,  procedures,  ma
nuals,  
training  
courses,  and  the  multitude  of  other  BM
S-related  agency
  products  
must  be
  
explicitly  a
cknowledged  and  preserved  in
  P
ontis  5.0  to
  the  greate
st  extent
  
possible.    
This  goal  also  means  provid
ing  a  straightforward  migration  path  for  
Pontis and
 integrated B
RIDGEWare database
s when moving to Pon
tis 5.0. 
We  ex
plicitly  recognize  that
  th
ese  
priorities  an

  ma

  over  time,  
and th
at t

to accommodate th

 in priorities and needs.

–  that
  
Pontis  5.0  
will  be  a  Microsoft  .NE

The  actual  development  strategy  will  mini

The design 
of Pontis 5.0 will be info
rm
ed by review of the r
esults of NCHRP 
Project   12-67,   Multiple-Objective   
Optimization   for   Bridge   Manag
ement   
Systems.  Additional funding may be re
quired 
to modify the Pontis modeling 
approach  to  incorporate  new
  approaches  
devel
oped  as  p
art  of  this  project.  
  
The  estima
tes  in  t
his  d
ocument  to  
no
t  at
tempt
  to  q
uantify  such  additional  
funding requirements. 
Pontis  5.0  
must  provide  well-defined  and  do
cumented  access  to  selected  
product fun
ctionality and data for third-party developers. 
The Pontis 5.0 business rules will be 
similar to those of Ponti
s 4.x. 
Where a conflict arises between 
5.0 r
equirements
 and 4.x
 beh
avior, or wh
en a 
4.x
 feature is being aban
doned or signif
icantly reworked, this design decision 
will be exp
licitly doc
umented and justified.  For example, the Pontis for
mula 
language an
d support for Pontis 2.0
 file ex
change formats are 
very likely to 
be discarded in Pontis 5
.0.  A conflic
t or concern may aris
e w
here there is an 
explicitly identified improvement to th
e 4
.x functional design, such as t
he 
organization and opera
tion of the S
elect tool for selecting bridges on the
 
Pontis desk
top in a Web deployed environment.  An agreed procedure and 
protocol wi
ll be needed 
to facilitate 
making a collecti
ve deci
sion on these 
sorts of high
ly visible functional changes. 
The Project Planning m
odule will
 be redesigne

 and appropriate.   
As  a  genera
l  goal,  Pontis  users  sho
uld  
be  comfortable  operating  and  u
sing  the  
software  aft
er  two  full  days  of  trai
ning.    User

ter   two   ho

stem   admini
strators   s
hould   be   
comfortable
  operating  and  maintaining  the  
sof
tware  after  user  training  
and  one
  
full day of system ad

The  syst
em
  developer  shall  consider  supporting  existing  custom  forms  and
  
reports  developed  in  PowerBuilde
r  9.  
  It  shall  
decide  on  a  
development  tool  for  
users so that they can continue to custom
ize Pontis and extend its capability.  Fo
r 
example,   custom   forms   and   reports   cr
eated   with   PowerBuilde
r   9   may   be
   
migrated   to   a   .NET   
application
   by   using   the   Sybase   DataWin
dow   .NET   
technology which is available in PowerBuilde
r 10.   
Integrating 
DataWindo
w .NET is likely a sh
ort-
term strateg
y to ease mi
gration of 
user  forms  and  reports  to  
Pontis
  5.0.
    A  st
ated  objective  for  Pont
is  5.0
  is
  
eliminating  dependency  on  PowerB
uilder
.    Ide
ally,  the  application  sh
ould  not
  
req
uire  any  particular  vendor  techn
ology  fo
r  re
port  or  for
m  generation,  such  as  
InfoMaker/PowerBuilder,  so  a  sunset  plan  
must  be  developed  to  
outline  
a  
strategy  to  meet  
this  
objective.
  
However,  the  application  shall  continue  to  
provide  a  
plug-in  cap
ability  to  integrat
e  third-party  .NET  data  displays  and
  
reports in the user workspace.

EQUIREMENT
S
 
This section 
describes general performance 
requi
rements for 
Pontis 5.0, including
 
its capacity (the volume of all types of data that
 can be stored in the re
pository) 
and its spe
ed (the time i
t takes
 to ex
ecute certain types of o
perations). 
Some  factors  that  deter
mine  the  ult
imate  performance  of  Pontis  are  outside  the  
control  of  this  project,  
and  rely  ins
tead  on
  decisions  an
d  a

•
 
The capacit

The  effective  speed  and

levels  on  the  network  t
hat  connect

the application; and 
•
 
A  standalone  database  
engine  will  cont
inue  to  be  necessar
y.    Performance  
objectives for the sta

se should be comparable.  
Some  of  these  factors  may  make  
it  impossible  to  achieve  the  performance
  
requirements  for  Pontis  5.0  outlined  in  
this  section.    However,  based  on  our
  
asses
smen
t  of  the  existing  condition  of  most  a
gency  syste
ms  and  infr
astructure,  
we think this outcome is unlikely.   
There  are  selected  lice
nsees,
  typically
  smaller  agencies,  
who  may  h
ave  much
  
lower powe
red comp
uter resou

eir performance 
must be acceptable as 
well, although not n

sarily comp
arable to larger installations.

EQ
UIREMENTS
 
This  section  outl
ines  the  minimal  r
equi
rements  for  effect
ively  operatin
g  Pontis  
5.0.  
  The  r
equirements
  for  both  thin-client  and  thick-client  applications  are
  
discussed.  Specific items are to be
 determined
.   
The  Pontis  application  
server  (
ASP
.NET)  
software  will
  run
  on  a  server
  located
  
within  a  (pr
esumably)  secure  fac
ilit
y  at  
each  agency.    Because  it  is  an  
ASP.NE
T  
application,  the  end  users  can  vary  in
  location  depending  on  the  
network
  
accessibility
  of  the  server.    The  Pontis  
database,  and  any  
other  datab
ases  to  be  
accessed  from  Pontis  may  be  co-located  
on  the
  same  server  machine,  
but  at  a
  
minimum  
must  be  accessibl
e  from  the  Pontis  application  server  
via  standard
  
database co
mmunication and conn
ection protocols. 
The   server   machine   will   
run
   Windows   Server   2003   or,   g
iven
   technology   
evolution,    
a    descendant    target
    serv
er    e
nvironment    identified    in    the
    
implementation  plan.    
The  server  
machin
e  must  have  all  necessary  software  to  
run  an  ASP.NET  appli
cation.    This  specifical
ly  i
ncludes,  but
  may  not  be  limited
  
to, IIS
30
, the .NET Frame
work and ASP.NET.  
Other web servers, appliances, an
d 
add-in  technologies  may  also  be  necessa
ry  depending  on  the  final  application
  
design. 
Back-end  server  stored  procedures  and  
server-side  functions  will  be  supported
  
and may be assumed to be usable in
 the tec
hnical design of 
Pontis 5.0.  This will 
require  implementation  of  the
  trigge
rs in 
native D
BMS p
rocedural code
.    Thi
s  
implies  that  it  is  very  li
kely  that  the  
server-side  code  will  vary  for  each  target  
DBMS,  even  if  the  inte
rfaces  remain  id
entical,  increasing  the  development  and
  
testing   effo
rt   with   the   significant   be
nefit   of   assigning
   processing   to   the   
appropriate application tier(s). 
Pontis  5.0  
will  be  desi
gned  to  be  used
  with  Internet  Explo
rer;  it  
may  work  
correct
ly   with   other   browsers   bu
t   th
is   can
not   be   guaranteed.
      G
iven   the   
predominance of IE in
 the browser 
market, it
 does not
 app
ear to be 
ne
cessary to 
consider support for other browsers, although this may ne
ed to be reconsidered 
if ex
ternal 
customers are running th
e app
lication(s) and nee
d to employ different 
browser technology such as Net
scape or Mozilla FireFox
. 
Standalone   
capabilit
ies   will   
requi
re   a   workstation   running   the   latest   .NET
   
Framework, presumably Windows XP Profe
ssional (SP2) o
r its successor.  Some
 
capabilit
ies  may  requir
e  a  network  connectio
n.    The  workstation’s  
hardware  
requirements will be similar to those 
of th
e existing Pontis 
4.4 applicatio
n.  There 
                              
                       
 
30
The TAG should stron
gly 
consider the 
need to supp
ort HTTP/www servers o
ther than 
IIS.  
Apache
 and its var
iant
s are the mo
st widely-used
 web se
rvers 
on the net 
an
d a rich
 
platform to exploit open source capabilities.  H
owever, m
any agencies rely on IIS, so 
this   technolo
gy   consideration   must   be   resolved   as   part   of   
   the   design

ecurity is a m
ix of database 
security a
nd application security.  Overall 
security  
is  
provided  by  the  datab
ase  
and  th
e  Pontis  5.0
  user  authentication  
mechanisms  with  more  
refined  security  ov
er  program  capabilit
ies  -  e.g.  create  a  
bridge - being addressed by the app
lication.   
It is assumed that authe
ntication will ut
ilize a single sign-on (SSO) approach and
 
application 
security will be declarativel
y managed through database or directory 
entries,  rath
er  than  har
d-wired  into  th
e  application.    This  mechanism  
may  have  
implications
  for  BRIDG
EWare/AASHTO
Ware  generally  and  will  need  to  b
e  
coordinated with the ot
her AASHTO products
31
. 
Database  secur
ity  will  
need  to  be  insu
red  for  the  Ponti
s  data  stor
ed  in  the  
RDBMS;  m
ost  likely  th
is  will
  be
  d
one  by  usin
g  a  specifi
c  username/password  
combination   and
   running   as
   particular   database   roles   
for   each   d
atabase
   
connection.    This  securi
ty  structure
  shou
ld  be  
similar  to  the  existing  security  
approach  in  Pontis  4.x.    For  web  client
s,  care  will  be  taken  to  i
nsure  that  
connection    information    is    not    accessible    from    application    pages    (e.g.,
    
userid/password embedded in HTML form va
riables).   
The  application  level  sec
urity  contro
ls  w
ill  be  c
onsistent  
with  current  Pontis  4.x  
procedures, except more
 comprehensive; no
 ex
ceptional controls are required.  
A 
specific re
quirement addresses field-level data secur
ity.   
For  normal  users,  the  
configura
bility  of
  the  s
ystem  via  the  interface  will  be
  
limited  to  changing  
the
  parameters
  used  to  pe
rform  the  various  analyses  
an
d  
modeling  functions.    Access  to  all  othe
r  co

  parameters,  such  as
  
module   access,   will   be   restricted   to

VERVIEW
 
In  order  to  develop  an  approximation  of  th
e  tot
al  effort  involved  and  create  the
  
development   plan   necessary   for   proj
ect   planning,   th
ree   implementation   
alternatives  have  been  identified  for  
consideration  by  th
e  BRIDGEWare  Task
  
Force.    These  alternatives  are  quite  diffe
rent  from  each  other,  particu
larly  i
n  
terms  of  schedule  and  user  impacts.    Th
e  alternatives  are  specified  in
  terms  of
  
effort, sched
ule, and deliverables. 
Development  effort  is  estimat
ed  
as  out
lined  in  section  6.2.    The  
estimating  
approach  provides  a  sta
ndardized  mec
hanism  
for  estimating  the  com

nvolved  
in  pro
viding
  a  co
mpon
ent  of  Pont
is  5.0,  which  can  be  
transformed
   into   development   ho
urs   or   cost
.      Based   o
n   the   e
stimate   of   
development   effort,   t
hree   alternat
ive   
development   app
roaches   have   been   
prepared.    The  schedules  for  Pontis  5.0  
are  intrinsically  l
inked  to  the  product’s  
revenue cycles which are directly 
rela
ted 
to subscribership.  
Hence, the schedules
 
shown  for  t
he  alternati
ves  reflect  availa
ble  monies  and  
assume  no  so
licitation
  
effort will b
e undertaken. 
The three alt
ernatives proposed for consideration are: 
1.
 
Dedicated  Design  and  Release
,  where  the
  entire  Ponti
s  5.
0  product  is  
designed, d
eveloped, tested, 
and delive
red
 as a 
single multi-year effort, 
with 
an ex
plicit cutover to the new versi
on at 
a future point in t
ime.  There 
are no 
interim rele
ases or initial pr
oducts in this alternative; 
2.
 
Phased  Design  and  Release
,  where
  components  of  Pontis  
5.0  are  desi
gned,
  
developed,  tested,  and  d
elivered  on  
a  fl
ow  basis  as  a  multi-year  effort,  with
  
initial effort
s focused on delivering 
a web based inspection module; and 
3.
 
Dedicated   Design   an
d   Phased   Release
,   w
hich   varies
   from   the   
second   
alternative b

dicated design task that will start and 
conclude  
be
fore  increm
ental  phased  de
velopm
ent  of  Ponti
s  5.0  component
s  
commences.
 
Each  of  these  alternati
ves  is  discussed  below,  with  a  summary,  an  outline  of  
driving  ass
umptions,  an  outline  of  major  development  tasks,  resou
rces,  and

Note  that  e

  the  
Pontis  and  Virtis/Opis  contractors  
will  
coord

contractor  
will  be  f

Pontis  effort  to  review  Po

documents.

The functional size of

0 ha
s been estimated using the Common 
Software
 
Measurement  Int
ernati
onal  Conso
rtium
  Full  
Function  Points  (COSMIC-FFP)  
method.
32
    The  COSMIC-FFP  size  scale  is  ba
sed  exclusively  on  
Functional  User
  
Req
uirements,  defined  as  “the  user  prac
tices  and  procedures  that  the
  software  
must  perform  to  fulfill  the  users’  
needs.”  
  Functional  user  requi
rements  exclud
e  
quality requirements an
d any tech
nical 
require
ments.  
The COSMIC-FFP 
method
 
is designed to work for 
“data-rich” and 
“real-time” softwar
e, and it provides the 
concepts   of   software   l
ayers   and   
tiers   
to   hel
p   differentiate   functional   user   
requirements   allocated   at   
differe
nt   levels   o
f   functi
onal   abstraction.      More   
information on this methodology can be found in Appendix 
A. 
The  COSMIC-FFP  meth
od  results  in  an  e
stima
te  of  Cosmi
c  function  size  units
  
(CFSU).      
This   estimate   is   multi
plied   
by   a
n   adjustme
nt   factor   reflecting   
application 
complexity to obtain “Adjusted CFSU,” and it may then be
 scaled as
 
appropriate to yield an e
stimate in 
terms 
of hours or development cost. 
 The cost 
estimate for Pontis is pre
sented in Table 
6.1.  Cos
ts were calibrated by comparing 
actual  development  costs  to  CFSU  e
stimates  for
  recent  Pontis  efforts.    Note  that
  
the  COSMIC-FFP  method  is  not  capable  of
  pro
viding  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of  
developing  
the  basic  ap
plication  fra
mework  an
d  C++  wrappers,  so  th
ese  items
  
were estima
ted separat
ely based on 
expert judgment. 
Note  that  t
he  estimate
s  provided  be
low  are  for  
the  development  costs  
only  and
  
do not include the cost of design or testin
g.  De
sign costs are anticipated to be 25 
percent  of  the  development  costs,
  with  an  a
dditional  $25,00
0  for  ea
ch  design
  
document produced.  Testing each re
lease is ex
pe
cted to cost 
$55,

Overview 
The  dedicated  design  and  release  
approa
ch  is  a  strategic  option  foc
used  on
  
deliver
ing  a  complete  p
roduct
  to  e
nd  users  at  a  single  p
oint  in  time
,  when  a  
wholesale  cutover  will  
be  performe
d  by  agen
cies  to  deploy  Pontis  5.0.  
  The  key  
characteristics  of  this  p
lan  are  few
er,  la
rger  tasks,  a  signi
ficant  initial  design  
effort, fewer interim deli
verables, a dedica
ted te
sting phase
, and a singl
e release, 
resulting in an intense, focused depl
oy
ment effo
rt for licensing agencies.
 
Driving Assumptions 
The driving 
assumptions behind thi
s approach are: 
1.
 
Agencies  d
o  not  want  multi
ple  d
eployment  efforts  in  o
rder  to  establish

A  single  
lar
ge  project  
with  a  com
plete  delive
rable  packa
ge  is  more  f
ocused
  
than  a  p
hased  effort  with  numerous  design,  develop,  and  release  
cycles,  
allowing a dedicated, continuous development team effort; 
3.
 
Changes   in   technology   will   be   relati
vely   stable   (e.g.   
the   development   
framework  will  not  change  radically  ov
er  time,  and  importantly  the  
work  
done  early  in  the  development  effort  w
ill  not  n
eed  to  be  revisited  later,  and  
possibly  o
verhauled  or
  significantly  reworked,  in  response  to  a  technology
  
change
33
);  
4.
 
The 
entire 
design and development effort
 can be contracted 
out as a package 
with a fixed price; 
5.
 
The  effort  can  be  broken  down  by  
contract  period  to  accommodate  revenue
  
cycles, if necessary; and 
6.
 
Pontis 4.x will continue to be maintai
ned throughout the development period
 
until  all
  ca
pabilities  ar
e  delivered,
  and  
at  least  2  interim  releases  may  be  
needed to 
address interim functi
onal needs in t
he user base.
 
Key Deliverables 
The key deliverables for 
this approach are:

database   upgrades,   functionality   
releases, or t
echnology upgrades. 
Driving Assumptions  
The driving 
assumptions behind thi
s approach are: 
1.
 
Agencies  already  need
  some  of  the  
projected  components/capabilities  of  
Pontis 5.0 earlier,
 partic
ularly, the web 
inspection
 capabilities 
and want th
em
 
expedited; 
2.
 
Agencies  ca
n  accommodate  serial,  incr
ement  releases  within  their  ow
n  IT  
planning schedules; 
3.
 
It is generall
y desirable to show results to the use
rs earlier; 
4.
 
Phased  dev
elopment  may  be  somewhat  less  te
chnology  dependent  in
  that  
new    technology    capabilit
ies    (e.g.    a    new    .NET    Fram
ework    or    
web
    
development paradigm) can be accommo
dated 
as the project progresses and 
releases components; 
5.
 
Smaller,    more    focused    releases
    may    offe
r    additional    flex
ibility    and
    
responsiveness to user f
eedback; 
6.
 
Pontis  5.0  c
omponents  
are  discrete  
and  may  
be  broken  
out  into  modular
  
releases; 
7.
 
There   may
   be   less   risk   in   modular   relea
ses,   in   t
hat   a   chang
e   of   
direction/emphasis/sc
hedule  in  response  
to  
external  factors  may  be
  more  
possible; 
8.
 
Design reviews are less
 complicated and
 more easily accommodated in busy 
manage
men
t schedules;
 
9.
 
Smaller rele
ases may map 
better into product 
revenue and contracting cycles; 
10.
 
Pontis  4.x  will  
continue  to  provid
e  si
gnificant  BMS  f
uncti
onality  for  
users  
until Pontis 5.0 capabilities are delivered; and

Overview 
This  alternative  differs  from  Altern
ativ
e  2  by  emphasizing
  a  d
edicated  design  
effort   followed   by   phased   deve
lopment   of   Pontis   5.
0   over   tim
e.      Th
e   
development  does  not  start  until  the  desi
gn  is  completed  and  approve
d.    This
  
alternative  does  emphasize  significant  pr
ototyping  efforts  intended  to  ”prove
  
out”  and  demonstrate  d
esign  concepts,  
which  serve  to  com
municate  key  design  
concepts  an
d  shape  
expectations  ab
out  th
e  future  product.    There  are  
multiple
  
release cycles in this 
alternativ
e, similar to Altern
ative 2.  
Driving Assumptions 
The driving 
assumptions behind thi
s approach are: 
1.
 
A dedicated design effort allows for adequate user input and feedback prior 
to development;

As   with   Alternative   2,   phas
ed
   developm
ent   may   b
e   somewh
at   less   
technology  dependent  in  that  new  technology  capabilit
ies  
(e.g.  a  new  .NET  
Framework  or  web  development  para

as  the  
project prog
resses and releases components; 
3.
 
A  phased,  
multiple  
rel
ease,  development  process  can  be  accommodated  by
  
agencies, a
s assumed in 
Alternative 
2; 
4.
 
Revenue  cycles  are  a  driving  factor,  and
  all  the  developm
ent  work  must  fit  
into current projections; 
5.
 
Pontis  4.x  will  
continue  to  provid

The  following  are  the  major  risks  
associated  
with  the  Po
ntis  5.0  development  
effort: 
Requirement  Creep:
  T
here  is  a  ri
sk  that  system  require
ments  will  
grow  
significantly beyond those conceive
d while developing the development cost
 
estimate.  T
his risk can be managed
 by developing a req
uirements document
 
prior to starting the deve
lopment effort.

Obsolescen
ce: 
There  is  a  risk  that  
the  .NET
  standard  will  become  obsolete  
during the product development cycle, or
 ve
ry soon after the new version of
 
Pontis is released.  This 
risk can be 
mitigated by adopting 
a pha
sed 
approach 
to the de
sign and/or the development effort. 
Development  Cost:  
Th
ere  is  a  risk  that  t
he  ac
tual  cost  of  the  development
  
effort will si
gnificantly exceed the estimates. 
Development Schedule: 
There is a risk that the development effort will take 
significantly longer than scheduled.  This
 may 
affect the license base
 if s
tate
s 
decide to develop their 
own syst
em 
or move to another syste
m. 
Resource  R
isk:  
There  is  a  risk  that  the  deve
loper  will  n
ot  have  sufficient
  
resources  to  complete  the  development,  
either
  because  of  staff  turnover  or  
because of a lack of technical experti
se. 
Changes  to  
the  NBI:  
There  is  a
  risk  
that  
the
  cha
nges  to
  th
e  NBI  planne
d  by  
the FHWA will signifi
cantly affect 
the 
development schedule or inc
rease the 
cost of the d
evelopment effort. 
Agency Custom Forms: 
There is a risk that t
he a
pproach taken to providing 
agency forms will not support easy 
migration from Pontis 4.x to Pontis 5.0. 
Maintaining  Pontis  4.x:
 T
here is a risk that the cost to m
aintain Pontis 4.x 
will  e
xceed  
budgeted  amounts.    This  could
  happen  if  there  are  changes  to  
PowerBuild
er or Sybase
 that require
 ma
jor revis
ions to Pontis 4.x durin
g the 
Pontis 5.x development cycle.  This ri
sk can be partially mitigated through a 
fix
ed price 
maintena
nce approach. 
User  Satisfaction:  
There  is  a  risk  
that  t
he  final
  product  m
ay  not  
meet
  user  
expectations, either beca
use it does 
not 
meet their re
quirem
ents or because it 
does  not  conform  to  their  technology  st
andard
s.    This  risk  can  be  managed
  
through the use of prototypes in the design phas
e and by following a phased 
development schedule.

Measuring Pontis 5.0 
Purpose of Measurement 
The purpose of measurement is to measure 
the
 size of FUR of Pontis 5.0 as they 
evolve as input to cost estimating an
d to the measurement of 
productivity. 
Scope of Measurement
 
The  scope  of  measurement  is  Po
ntis  5.
0,  including  wor
k-output  ob
tained  by  
using existi
ng re-usable code. 
Measurement Viewpoint
 
The end-user measurement viewpoint allows 
a functional size to be measured of 
business application software as 
spe
cified 
in the Functional User Requirement.

Measuring Mathematical Algorithms 
COSMIC-FFP  is  not  suited  for  me
asur
ing  complex  mathematical  a
lgorithms,  
which  are  a

  To  account  for  this  limitation,  the  
measurer   i
s   allowed   
to   assign   locally
-determined   functional   size   to   the   
exceptional 
functionality.
