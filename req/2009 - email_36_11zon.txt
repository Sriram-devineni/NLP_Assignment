Requirements Specification 
1. 
Enterprise E-mail Scope 
Define the scope of the “Enterprise E-mail” project
.  (from F.S. 282.34 and Preliminary 
Scope Statement).  
282.34
 
 
Statewide e
-
mail system.
--A state e-mail system that includes the service d
elivery and 
support for a statewide e-mail, messaging, and cale
ndaring service is established as an 
enterprise information technology service as define
d in s. 
282.0041.
 The service shall be 
designed to meet the needs of all executive branch 
agencies and reduce the current cost of 
operation and support. 
The product of this project will be a proposed plan
 for the establishment of the statewide 
electronic mail system. By December 31, 2009, the A
EIT shall submit the proposed plan 
to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and t
he Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. The plan shall be developed to red
uce costs to the state and include, 
at a minimum:  
a) An analysis of the in-house and external sourcin
g options that should be considered 
for delivery and support of the service. The analys
is shall include an internally hosted 
system option, an externally sourced system option,
 and, if necessary, a combined in-
house and externally sourced option.  
b) A cost-benefit analysis that estimates all major
 cost elements associated with each 
sourcing option, including the nonrecurring and rec
urring costs of each option. The 
analysis must also include a comparison of the tota
l cost of each enterprise e-mail 
sourcing option and the total cost of existing e-ma
il services in order to determine the 
level of savings that can be expected.  
c) Estimated expenditures for each state agency ass
ociated with e-mail costs for the 
2009-2010 fiscal year.  
d) The plan must identify any existing e-mail infra
structure that should be considered for 
reuse.  
e) A concise analysis of the ability of each sourci
ng option to meet major system 
requirements, including federal and state requireme
nts for confidentiality, privacy, and 
security.  
f) A complete description of the scope of functiona
lity, operations, and required 
resources associated with each sourcing option.  
g) Recommendations for standardizing the format of 
state e-mail addresses.  
h) A reliable schedule for the decommission of all 
state agency e-mail systems and the 
migration of all agencies to the new system beginni
ng by July 1, 2010, and completing 
by June 30, 2013.

Requirements Workgroup Methodology 
Define the process by which requirements were gathe
red and grouped as either “basic” 
or “extended”.  
The primary objective for the requirements workgrou
p was to gather all functional requirements 
for the state e-mail system (via excel spreadsheet)
 and compile all requirements into a 
complete, concise, and categorized functional requi
rements specification. The activities required 
to compile the requirements specification included 
reviewing the 2006 e-mail survey (and 
additional historical documentation), creating the 
2009 e-mail survey, sending 2009 survey to 
agency e-mail (business) experts, compiling survey 
results into the formal requirements 
specification, and obtaining requirements approval 
from key stakeholders. 
Note: There are two 
subsequent surveys being sent out (to gather curren
t agency inventory and financial 
information); the results of these two subsequent s
urveys are not included in this document. 
 
The workgroup reviewed the 2006 survey (and other d
ata sources such as schedule IV-C data 
and AEIT DCC questionnaire) and determined the list
 of categories and questions to be 
included in the survey. Agencies were asked to resp
ond to each requirement question by 
selecting “currently have and use”, “do not have/do
 not use”, or “would like to have”.  Agreed 
upon categories for the 2009 survey included
 
E-mail, Calendar, & Contacts (user interface and 
administrative requirements); Archiving, Retention,
 Search, Discovery requirements; Disaster 
Recovery requirements, Backup & Restore requirement
s; Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering 
requirements; Remote Access & Mobile Messaging requ
irements; Additional E-mail 
requirements. The survey also provided a section fo
r agencies to address their concerns/issues 
regarding a statewide e-mail system. 
 
Upon receiving all survey responses, the workgroup 
determined which requirements should be 
recommended for inclusion in the “basic” and “exten
ded” section of the functional requirements 
specification. Factors that were considered in the 
basic or extended decision included, % of 
agencies that currently provide, # of total users c
urrently supported, and the legal necessity of 
fulfilling the requirement. The workgroup also iden
tified whether the requirement will be a user, 
agency admin, or SSRC admin capability.  
 
Once approval of this document is obtained from key
 stakeholders, these functional 
requirements will be used as an attachment in upcom
ing RFI’s and potential RFP’s (or ITN’s). 
An in house or externally sourced solution should m
eet the basic functional requirements 
specified in this document (or provide ample reason
ing why a requirement is not technically or 
financially feasible).

Functional Requirements Summary  
 
The functional requirements discovery and analysis 
process yielded the following results: 
 
•
 
Email, Calendar, and Contacts
 service category had a 97% “have and use” response
 average. 
•
 
Archiving, Retention, Discovery
 service category had a 66% “have and use” response
 average and a 
23% “would like to have” response average. 
•
 
Disaster Recovery
 service category had a 59% “have and use” response
 average and a 34% “would like 
to have” response average. 
•
 
Backup & Restore
 service category had a 79% “have and use” response
 average and a 19% “would like 
to have” response average. 
•
 
Security, Anti-Virus, Filtering
 service category had a 67% “have and use” response
 average and a 24% 
“would like to have” response average. 
•
 
Remote Access, Mobile Messaging
 service category had a 71% “have and use” response
 average and 
an 11% “would like to have” response average. 
•
 
Additional E-mail 
service category had a 48% “have and use” response 
average and a 26% “would like 
to have” response average. 
 
 
Based on these results, the majority of requirement
s for each category made it into the basic requirem
ents 
recommendation. In each category except for email, 
calendar and contacts,  
the survey showed that there is a potential need fo
r extended services (varying service components, se
rvice 
levels, and costs). This is especially likely for t
he archiving, disaster recovery, security, and remo
te – mobile 
messaging categories. The survey also verified that
 more than half of agencies polled currently have a
nd use a 
document collaboration and workflow application. Ho
wever, in keeping within the scope of the statewide
 “e-mail, 
messaging, and calendaring” system proposal, it was
 agreed that collaboration services (such as shared
 
documents and workflows, instant messaging, and dis
cussion forums) should remain out of scope for this
 project. 
Finally, the technical and financial feasibility of
 each functional requirement will be further evalua
ted by the 
Enterprise E-mail technical and financial workgroup
s prior to submitting the proposed plan for statewi
de e-mail by 
December 31, 2009.
