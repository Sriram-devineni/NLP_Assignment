1.  Introduction  
1.1 
General overview of the VMUS (Voucher Maintenance Unit Sy
stem) 
Sy
stem Development: 
 
The system will be developed on Oracle 9i platform 
Front end will be VB (visual basic) 
Reports will be crystal reports 9 
 
Sy
stem design: 
 
The system will be user friendly with maximum ma
ster table structure with all transaction 
screens to have drop down selection menus to mi
nimize data entry errors. The main data 
entry screen on claims entry to have drop drown 
menu from patient’s profile selection to 
medicine cost to have drop down. Minimize t
he use of key board for any number entry to 
have a faster transaction data entry. 
The system will be easily trainable for the user
 with minimum computer skill with simple 
user step by step manual. 
 
Storage efficiency
: 
 
The structural design of the database will 
have sequential links with surrogate keys. The 
database storage will be highly efficient to
 manage and avoid empty unused spaced 
blocked, properly defragmenter
 on a periodic basis. This efficiency will have a maximum 
provision to expand this program beyond the p
ilot period, if the program requirements 
remain same. 
 
Security
: 
 
High intrusion controls will be in place in
 the system and the database. Access level 
controls, various organizational level user 
setting by including granular model setting.

1.2  Purpose  
The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  explai
n  the  flow  and  the  requi
rement  of  Voucher  
Management System (VMU) required by Marie 
Stopes International Uganda (MSIU) during 
the  various  meetings  held  betw
een  MSIU  and  Microcare  from  28
th
  of  Nov  2005  to  30
th
  of  
Nov  2005.  This  document  is  purely  based  on  t
he  Functional  Flow  Diagram  designed  by  
Microcare.  The  document  will  ex
plain  every  small  entity  of  
the  system  including  various  
code  generations,  Bar-coding  and  Graphical  User  
Interface  etc.  This
  document  will  help  
the  system  development  team  
to  understand  the  overall  and  det
ailed  functions  of  every  
small entity in VMU and to desi
gn the system that will meet ev
ery requirement of the VMU 
program.  This document will help the testing 
team to prepare the Test Cases and will help 
them  to  test  every  module  in
  the  system  and  overall  testing  
of  the  system,  so  that  the  
testing team will have confidence 
on the quality of this system.
 
1.3  Project  
Scope  
. 
1.3.1 about MSIU and OBA Program 
 
The concept of Output-based Aid (OBA)
 
  
Past experiences with development aid showed,
 that financing input
s, e.g. facilities 
and equipment, does not result 
in the necessary improvem
ent of health outcomes. 
Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA c
oncept finances agree
d outputs with pre-
defined  quality  rather  than  pr
e-defined  inputs  by  selling  v
ouchers for STD services 
at  subsidised  prices  to  
patients.  These  vouchers  will  be  refunded  to  service  
providers  in  the  private  
sector  (medical  doctors,  qualified  nurses  and  midwives),  
government hospitals, NGOs, and faith-based organisations. 
 
The major advantages of the OBA 
approach are, that it allows 
 
 
To target resources to address selected health problems, 
 
 
To target the provision of services to
 specific parts of the population and  
 
 
To stimulate private market 
initiative and competition.

The approach was successfully applied in the 
sixties/seventies in South Korea and 
Taiwan.  In  recent  years  also  a  progra
mme  was  run  in  Nicar
agua  but  the  OBA  has  
not been implemented in lar
ger scale programs.  
 
Objective of the OBA Programme in Uganda is to provide 
 
 
Quality health care services for STD treatment, 
 
For the sexually active populat
ion of the Mbarara district, 
 
Through a voucher system, 
 
By qualified, approved providers, 
 
For a pilot phase of 1 year. 
The  principles  of  the  voucher,  the  cont
ents  of  the  health  care  services,  their  
required quality, the standards to be met by 
the providers and their infrastructure, as 
well as the measures for monitoring t
he quality have been defined in the PDS.  
 
 
Basic structures and processes of the STD voucher programme
 
The main structures and processes in
 the STD voucher programme are: 
 
The   programme   is   prepared,   impl
emented   and   managed   by   the   Voucher   
Management Unit (VMU). 
 
The  VMU  establishes  a  network  of  approv
ed  providers  (during  the  pilot  phase  
private, NGO, FBO providers)
 throughout Mbarara District. 
 
The VMU runs a marketing and behavioural
 change campaign (BCC) to market and 
inform about the voucher services and how to use them.  
 
 
The  VMU  establishes  and  runs  a  distributi
on  system  with  the  purpos
e  to  distribute  
the STD vouchers to the sexually active
 population for which the above-mentioned 
providers are in reach.

Distribution follows certain rules: 
 
• 
The  vouchers  are  packed  in  two  with  one  
voucher  for  the  purchaser  of  the  
voucher,  in  the  following  addressed  as  
“client”  and  one  for  the  partner  of  the  
client. 
 
• 
The  voucher  may  only  be  bought  for  personal  
treatment  or  for  
the  treatment  of  
the  partner.  Only  one  voucher  is  sold  at
  time.  The  option  of  selling  more  than  
one voucher to a person at a time introduces too many sources for fraud. 
 
• 
Distributors  keep  a  distribution  list  doc
umenting  distributor,  voucher  number,  
date, place of sale, and name and pl
ace of living of the customer. 
 
The client may honour the voucher at 
any approved provider of his choice. 
 
STD  treatment  according  to  the  National  
Treatment  Algorithms  for  STD  in  Uganda  
(NTA),  adapted  for  this  voucher  scheme  (T
A-OBA,  treatment  algorithms  for  STD  
treatment in the OBA scheme), is given to
 clients for free for the syndromes of 
 
1.  Urethral  
discharge  
2. 
Abnormal vaginal discharge 
3.  Genital  
ulcer  
4.  Inguinal  
bubo  
5.  Ophthalmia  
neonatorum  
6. 
Acute scrotal swelling 
7. 
Pelvic inflammatory disease 
 
In line with the NTA the voucher includes  
 
 
First consultation with basic lab testing and treatment 
 
First  follow-up  visit  for  all  clients.  
If  symptoms  persist  drug  regimen  will  be  
switched.  
 
If necessary second follow-up visit. If sympt
oms persist referral to a hospital. 
 
Provider  documents  each  voucher  case  
in  a  standardised  pat
ient  treatment  
documentation form. 
 
At the end of each mont
h they hand in – respectively the claims processing agency 
(CPA) collects –  
 
 
The voucher for each patient

 
The standardised patient treatment doc
umentation form for each patient and 
 
A  summary  claims  form  containing  a  summary  of  all  treated  voucher  cases  to  
the VMU for reimbursement. 
 
The data from the forms is entered into
 a computer database. Data checks and 
plausibilisations are done.  
 
Clean claims will be reimbursed via bank transfer.  
 
Conspicuous claims will be invest
igated and cleared by the VMU. 
 
The  VMU  operates  a  monitoring  system  
including  follow-up  with  patients  to  
monitor proper operation of
 the voucher scheme.  
 
 
 
1.3.2 About Voucher Management sy
stem  
 
The  voucher  management  system  VMS  is  
designed  to  atomize  the  process  of  
Voucher Management Unit (VMU) to minimize
 the manual process to maximize the 
quality of the project to under
stand the progress and timely out come of the project 
to  take  necessary  steps  by  the  MSIU  Ad
min  team  to  plan  for  the  future  and  to  
increase  the  quality  of  the  STD  voucher  se
rvice.  The  system  will  also  control  the  
existence  of  fraud  in  claims  and  will  help  
the  service  provider  to  reach  their  
payments  in  time  without  delay.  The  other
  features  and  details
  of  system  will  be  
explained in below sections in the document. 
  
The voucher management system is subdivided 
into following modules to make the 
system easy for understanding, developing, testing and to implement.

Description  
2.1  Sy
stem  
Perspective  
This section of the document is going to ex
plain the functionalitie
s of the system, its 
subsystems and how it’s int
egrated and working together. 
During the system study, 
it  was  understood  that  the  fi
rst pilot period, twenty thousand vouchers will be sold, 
but the VMU-system has the pr
ovision to upgrade to meet 
the additional market and 
projects needs. 
 
2.1.1 Outline of entire sy
stem
 
 
• 
The VMU will create the vouchers and sell it 
to clients through distributors.  
• 
The distributor will submit the sa
les details back to the VMU. 
• 
Each voucher should have two portions wit
h three tear off voucher slips each 
for Client and Partner.  
• 
The  client  and/or  the  partner  will  c
hoose  the  service  provider  and  will  get  
treatment.  
• 
First  visit  is  called  as  Consultation  and  
if  the  patient  is  not  cured  then  they  
can go for first follow up and second follow up,  
• 
If the patient is not cur
ed then the doctor will refer t
he patient to some other 
Hospitals the hospital may be another VSP or any other.  
• 
Each visit details (including Diagnosis, 
Lab Test and Drugs) of
 the patient is 
called a claim, 
• 
The  VSP  will  submit  the  claim  
to  VMIU  field  office  to  enter  those  into  the  
database,

• 
The filed office will validate the claim form manually and through system,  
• 
If any of mandatory information is missed 
or any false information is existing 
then the field office will reject the 
claim back to VSP and the system will keep 
those claim in a quarantine area. 
• 
The  quarantined  forms  will  be  sent  back  to
  the  VSP  for  verification,  if  the  
VSP returns the claim with satisfactory
 details, the claims will be entered on 
to the system, in the following month’s batch. 
• 
Based on the payment terms agreed by 
VSP, the field office will generate Bi-
Month  or  Monthly  financial  and  medica
l  report  and  send  it  to  MSIU  Admin  
team to arrange the payments for the VSP.  
• 
To  understand  the  satisfaction  of  client  
the  MSIU  Admin  team  will  get  client  
feedback  from  some  of  the  clients  and  
send  those  documents  to  field  office  
to enter those into database. 
 
As mentioned above the entire 
system is sub-divided into six modules and again the 
each module is subdivided into different subsystems.  
 
 
2.1.2 Voucher Management Sy
stem Modules
 
 
 
1. 
Voucher Creation / Preparation 
 
Voucher creation – the voucher num
bers are system generated and created 
with   unique   identification   
numbers   with   security   protocols   in-built.   The   
created unique numbers are then 
printed out in the form of bar-codes, which 
will  complement  (or  stuck  on  the  vouche
r)  the  voucher.  Then  at  every  level  
on  the  voucher  cycle  this  number  is  capt
ured,  on  distribution,  retail  sales,  
point of treatment, enclos
ed along with claim forms, at the claims processing 
and finally for the payment. Such tracking records will be utilized for reports 
as  well.  Each  voucher  should  have  
the  following  properties,  which  will  have  
sub-elements  to  get  the  batch  numbers,
  voucher  numbers,  
and  the  project  
codes. 
Project  code  –  Group  batch
  code  –  Batch  number  –  Voucher  number  –  
Security code. 
 
• 
Project Code (2 Digit) Example: P001 
 
• 
Group  Batch  (3  Digit)  each  group  bat
ch  has  a  batch  of  100  Batches  
Example: GP0001

• 
Batch number (2 Digit) approximatel
y each batch will have 10 vouchers  
 
• 
Voucher number (10 digit)  
 
• 
Security Code 
 
• 
All codes will be printed out in the form of Bar  
 
• 
Additionally the provision for validity dat
e check for the period of vouchers to 
be  used  in  the  program  is
  provided.  This  validity  date  can  be  amended  or  
altered at the system level 
ONLY by the authorized user. 
 
• 
Voucher will also have MRP (maximum retail price) 
 
• 
Voucher should have three tear off por
tioned slips with a sub-section tear-off 
for the partner.  
 
• 
If  the  tear  off  voucher  slips  would  be  
sticker  then  it  will  not  be  lost  on  
attaching to the claim forms by the VSP.  
 
• 
Each  voucher  slip  should  contain  t
he  bar  code  of  the  Voucher  with  two  
identifications one for the client
 and the other for the partner. 
 
• 
The first tear for the first consultation 
 
• 
Second one for the first follow-up 
 
• 
And the third tear off for the final (second follow-up). 
 
 
Design Constraints
 
This  system  has  high  security
  feature  as  far  as  the  user  access  to  the  system,  
including all the modules, sub-modul
es and even at the screen level. 
 
• 
The voucher will be created ONLY
 by the authorized person. 
• 
The will be a provision to 
create a minimum quantity of vouchers at one time 
(such minimum numbers will be decided by the management team).
