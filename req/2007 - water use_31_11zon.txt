Introduction 
1.1
 
Purpose 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
is a collection and or
ganization of all the 
requirements surrounding a project.  As the Visi
on Document was a broad statement of user 
needs, goals and objectives, and 
features of the system, the SR
S begins the detailing of those 
needs and features, and how they are going to be
 implemented in the solution.  The SRS is a 
collection, or package, of artifact
s that describe the complete ex
ternal behavior of the system 
(i.e., what the system has to 
do to deliver those features). 
 
Following the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and its
 iterative nature, the SRS is not a frozen 
document, but rather a living artif
act.  It has a number of uses as the developer begins the 
implementation efforts.  It serves as a basis 
for communication between a
ll parties (i.e., between 
the developers themselves, between the develope
rs and the stakeholders).  The SRS will also 
serve as input to software testing and quality a
ssurance checks.  During testing, Test Cases will 
be created to ensure that the developed system
 does indeed fulfill the requirements outlined in 
the SRS. 
1.2
 
Overview 
The Water Use Tracking (WUT) System’s SRS, as out
lined above, is a collec
tion of artifacts that 
have been developed separately during the Implem
entation Phase of the project.  This packaging 
of artifacts will include information from the following documents: 
•
 
Vision Document 
•
 
Requirements Workshops Summaries 
•
 
Requirement Traceability Matrix 
•
 
Use Case Model and Use Cases 
•
 
Supplementary Specification 
 
This SRS outlines the process the WUT Project Development Team followed to gather the 
requirements for the project.  This document will also describe how the requirement statements 
gathered from the stakeholders make their wa
y into use case documents and, eventually, into 
features of the system.

Project Scope 
The vision of the Water Use Tracking (WUT
) System, as captured during the Executive 
Stakeholders Workshop, defines the system as: 
 
“A GIS-based system that allows District empl
oyees and external customers to spatially and 
temporally track and analyze key Regul
atory and Resource Management data.” 
 
This system will support Southwest Florida Wate
r Management District’s (SWFWMD) activities 
defined in the Southern Water Use Caution Ar
ea (SWUCA) Management Plan and to validate 
and assess the results of the SWUCA II Rules.  
Although this system is being built to support the 
efforts within the SWUCA, it will support the sa
me functionality for anywhere within the 
District. 
2.1
 
 Problem Statement 
Rules are in the process of being implemented 
in support of the SWUCA 
Recovery Strategy that 
has no current, automated way of being validated or
 assessed in their fulfillment of the needs of 
the plan.  One problem is no formal or consiste
nt system exists at the District (manual or 
automated) to comprehensively track and analyz
e geographic and temporal trends in permitted 
and actual water uses within the SWUCA.  Curren
tly, tracking of spatial and temporal trends in 
permitted and actual water uses is done using manual and semi-automated methodologies by a 
number of groups in the District.   
 
Examples of current work include monthly summary reports of permitted pumpage developed by 
the Technical Services Department, annual wate
r use estimates developed by the Conservation 
Projects Department, and ad hoc maps of perm
itted pumpage developed by the Mapping and GIS 
Section (MGIS).  This approach 
is staff time intensive, and sin
ce data sources and methodologies 
vary between different groups conducting these 
analyses, it may lead to inconsistent or 
apparently conflicting resu
lts.  This is further complicated by the fact that current database 
management systems and data collection activitie
s were not specifically designed to support 
these types of activities.  The result is that 
the current system does not
 adequately support the 
types of analyses required for successful im
plementation of the SWUCA Management Plan. 
2.2
 
Product Position Statement 
The WUT Project will provide soft
ware for several different customer types.  As outlined in the 
SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking 
Application – Feasibility Study
, the primary groups who 
will be using the system are: 
 
Water Use Permit (WUP) Evaluators –
 The system will assist in the WUP review process. 
 
Technical Services Staff –
 The system will be used to track
 and analyze long-term trends in 
permitted and actual water use and to assist in identifying underlying causes for these trends 
(land use change, socio-economic conditions, environm
ental factors, etc.).  It will also provide 
tools that can be used to aggregate permitted and actual pumpage over specified geographic areas 
(model grid cells, counties, Most Imp
acted Area (MIA), watershed, etc.).

Records and Data Staff –
 The system will provide tools to a
ssist in the quality control/quality 
assurance of WUP data. 
 
Resource Conservation and Development Department –
 The system will provide information 
that can be used to assist in the calibration of 
ground water models.  The system will also provide 
information on WUPs that can support the esta
blishment and monitoring of Minimum Flows and 
Levels.  In addition, the system
 will provide information that 
assists in the development of 
estimated water use 
 
Planning Department
 –
 The system will provide tools to assi
st in studies analyzing impacts of 
changing demographics and economic condi
tions on water use within the SWUCA. 
 
Executive Staff/Governing Board – 
The system will provide standard reports that are published 
as hardcopy or web-accessible documents.  
Web accessible maps and documents could be 
interactive, allow users to zoom, 
pan, and query areas of interest. 
 
External Customers –
 External customers potentially includ
e local governments, the media, and 
the general public.  Standard inte
ractive map interfaces will provide information in a consistent, 
low maintenance environment. 
 
Other Users –
 This system is in line 
with the objectives of th
e CWM Information Technology 
initiative presented to the Governing Board in
 June 2002.  It will provide improved access to 
WUP data for all District staff.

2.4
 
Project Environment 
2.4.1
 
Hardware/Software Environment 
The proposed system does not appear to require 
any significant hardware 
or software resources 
beyond that which currently exists, or is pl
anned for implementati
on, at the District. 
2.4.1.1
 
IBM DB2 Data Server 
The IBM DB2 data server was upgraded in Ja
nuary 2003 and it is anticipated that it has 
sufficient capacity to support the 
proposed system.  It is likewise
 anticipated that the current DB2 
database software configuration will support the proposed system.  
2.4.1.2
 
HP-UX ArcSDE/Oracle Data Server 
The District is currently retiring the obsolete 
HP Tru-64 computer system and replacing it with 
an HP-UX system.  It is anticipated that when 
this upgrade is completed in fiscal year (FY) 2004 
that the system will have suffi
cient capacity to support the proposed system.  It is likewise 
anticipated that when the upgrade is comple
ted, current ArcSDE/Oracle database system 
configuration will support the proposed system. 
2.4.1.3
 
Communications/Data Network 
The primary impact of this system on the network will occur during the transfer of data between 
the IBM and HP-UX systems.  Since this transfer
 will occur only during non-business hours, it is 
not anticipated that it will
 have a significant impact
 on the current network. 
2.4.1.4
 
Web/ArcIMS Servers 
The current Web/ArcIMS Server environment w
ill be expanded in FY 2004 to support of CWM 
activities and it is anticipated that
 it will have sufficient capacity to support the proposed system.  
In the event that these servers are not adequate
, they are relatively 
inexpensive to upgrade. 
2.4.1.5
 
Desktop Workstations 
It is anticipated that this system will opera
te within the ArcGIS ArcView and ArcIMS web 
browser environment that is curren
tly implemented at the District. 
2.5
 
Product Perspective 
The system will require a combination of pe
rmitting, geographic, and water resource data 
derived from the following sources. 
2.5.1
 
WUP Data 
The data source for WUPs is the Regulatory Database (RDB).  This database is implemented in 
the IBM DB2 environment on the District's IBM 
mainframe data server located in the Tampa 
Data Center.  The Records and Da
ta Department is the primary entity responsible for the entry 
and maintenance of the data in the RDB.  Th
e Information Resources Department (IRD) is 
responsible for the design, developm
ent, and maintenance of the RDB. 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
7
2.5.2
 
Geographic Data 
The data source for geographic data is the GI
S.  This database is implemented in the 
ArcSDE/Oracle environment on the District's HP
-UX data server located in the Brooksville 
computer room.  The Mapping and GIS Section (MGI
S) is the primary entity responsible for the 
entry and maintenance of most of the data in 
the GIS.  The Land Resources, Operations, and 
Records and Data Departments maintain specialize
d datasets within the GIS.  IRD and MGIS are 
jointly responsible for the design, devel
opment, and maintenance of the GIS. 
2.5.3
 
Water Resource Data 
It is anticipated that data 
on ground and surface water levels, wa
ter quality, stream flows, and 
climatological trends will be used in this sy
stem.  The source for these data is the Water 
Management Database (WMDB).  This database
 is implemented in the IBM DB2 environment 
on the District's IBM mainframe data server loca
ted in the Tampa Data Center.  The Operations 
Department is the primary entity responsible
 for the entry and maintenance of the water 
levels/flows and meteorological da
ta in the RDB.  Water quality data stored in the WMDB are 
collected by multiple departments, processed by th
e District's laboratory, and loaded into the 
WMDB.  It is important to note that while almo
st all water level information collected by the 
District is entered into the WM
DB, loading of water quality da
ta is less common.  The WMDB, 
therefore, does not provide a comprehensive co
llection of water quality data. The Information 
Resources Department (IRD) is responsible for 
the design, development, and maintenance of the 
WMDB. 
2.5.4
 
GIS/RDB/WMDB Data Integration 
The proposed system will require the integration of
 data in the GIS, RDB,
 and WMDB.  Data in 
these systems are logically linked using a common 
identifier known as the 
Universal ID (UID).  
Each WUP withdrawal point and da
ta collection site is assigned a UID.  UIDs are unique for 
physical objects such as wells, rain
 gauges, and stream gauges.  
Unique UIDs are also assigned 
to surface water quality sample sites.  In cases 
where a well is both associated with a WUP and 
also serves as a data collection site, it is as
signed a single UID that provides linkages to data 
stored in both the RDB and WMDB.  In the GIS, 
the UID is associated with a physical location 
and, therefore, can be represented within a da
ta layer representing WUPs, stream gauges, or 
rainfall stations. 
 
Data are physically transferred from the DB
2-based WMDB and RDB to the ArcSDE/Oracle 
based GIS using the Transformation Server softwa
re.  This software provides tools for moving 
data between databases in their entirety or as sele
cted subsets.  While this transfer is currently 
only done from the WMDB/RDB to the GIS, it is tec
hnically possible to transf
er data in the other 
direction. 
2.6
 
Assumptions and Dependencies 
Requirements have surfaced that require data that 
is currently not available, either not collected 
or not stored in one of the data
bases (e.g., relocated quantities, laps
ed quantities, etc.).  It is 
assumed that the needed changes, to collect and 
store the data, will be made within the current 
application and database.  These changes would 
need to be implemented on the mainframe and it 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project –

Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
8
is assumed this would not be within the scope of 
this project.  However, 
if the required changes 
cannot be completed to the current systems in 
a timely manner, the WUT System will need to 
implement these requirements 
within the new application. 
 
It is also assumed that the curr
ent databases mentioned above are 
still available in their current 
form during the development of the WUT System
.  The WUT System will be dependent on the 
data stored in the WUP, WMDB
, GIS, and RDB databa
ses.  Changes to the current systems 
would need to be done in collaboration w
ith the WUT Project Development Team.  
Communication between the responsi
ble parties is key in the succe
ss of the development of this 
system. 
 
One requirement for the WUT System is that 
it will be developed with the hardware and 
software architecture currently in
 place at the District.  Change
s to the current architecture 
requirements could have a negative impact on the 
development of this system and cause delays 
in the release of the system. 
2.7
 
Needs 
The following is a list of needs that were captured in the 
SWUCA Permitted Water Use Tracking 
Application – Feasibility Study
.  These needs and the requirements gathered at the Requirements 
Workshops will be consolidated and presented to the Stakeholders at the Requirements Summary 
Workshop for discussion and prioritization.

Tracking changes in permit ownership 
•
 
Identifying withdrawal points with lapsed pe
rmitted quantities.  As used here, lapsed 
quantities refer to any reductions in permitted pu
mpage for a particular well.  These may be 
the result of expiration of a perm
it, purchase of land that leads 
to retiring of a WUP, changes 
in predominant use type, plugging of well, or an
y other event that lead
s to a reduction in the 
permitted withdrawal from that point. 
•
 
Aggregate permitted pumpage, actual use, and lapsed quantities for defined geographic areas 
•
 
Must be able to analyze the 
impacts of alternative supplies 
on pumpage in a particular 
geographic area

Requirements Gathering Process 
By following the RUP process, the WUT Projec
t Development Team is executing a software 
development approach that is itera
tive, architecture-centric, and us
e-case driven.  Use cases are a 
very important artifact of the initial phase of th
e project.  The RUP outlines a process of how the 
development team goes from a vision of the system to be built, to specific requirements extracted 
from stakeholders, and, finally, to
 a use case model and use cases. 
3.1
 
Requirement Workshops and Summaries 
Requirement workshops were held
 in the initial week
s of the project to gather the user’s 
requirements to the system.  The stakeholders for th
e project are categorized 
into four categories:  
Executive Staff, Technical Staff, Science Business 
Staff, and Regulatory St
aff.  Workshops were 
held for each of these groups with follow-up one
-on-one interviews to clarify or refine 
requirements.  The agenda for each of these workshops was tailored to each of these groups.  For 
example, the Executive Staff meeting is more focused on the vision of the project.  The 
Technical Staff meeting is more focused on the 
technical requirements of
 the project.  The 
remaining two groups, mostly made up of the pow
er-users of the system, concentrated on the 
actual requirements of the system.  An addi
tional workshop was held to outline specific 
requirements needed for the system to suppor
t the SWUCA Recovery Plan.  A summary was 
produced for each of the workshops and distributed 
to the participants for 
review.  Feedback was 
received through the review pro
cess and the summaries were update
d to reflect these comments. 
3.2
 
Requirements Traceability Matrix 
All the requirements gathered during the re
quirement workshops were reviewed and 
consolidated into the Requirements Traceability 
Matrix (RTM).  The purpose of the WUT RTM 
is to document and manage the business and func
tional requirements for the WUT Project.  The 
WUT RTM provides a master list of business a
nd functional requirements organized into a 
number of meaningful features, ea
ch of which is a set of logically
 related requirements.  Within 
the matrix, each requirement is mapped to one
 or more use cases within the WUT Use Case 
Model that supports the requirement.  Once 
all requirements are mapped to a use case, 
SWFWMD is guaranteed that all business and functional requirements will be supported by the 
WUT software system.  The WU
T RTM also provides a means to scope the WUT Project for 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
10
success by prioritizing the features 
and/or requirements associated
 with each feature across the 
various releases of the WUT System. 
 
For purposes of requirements management
 
and traceability, the requestor(s) of each requirement 
is included in the matrix.  This allows the pr
oject development team to easily know whom to 
contact if questions or concerns
 arise during the development of 
the system regarding a certain 
requirement.  The capability to map these requ
irements increases the likelihood that upon the 
customer acceptance of a software solution that 
supports all the use case
s within the Use Case 
Model, the project development team will have delivered a software product that fulfills the 
customer’s needs. 
 
As more detailed and precise information is le
arned about the water use permitting analysis and 
reporting business processes throughout the WU
T Project life cycle, the WUT RTM will be 
updated to refine existing requirements statemen
ts and to capture new 
business and functional 
requirements as they are identified.  Keeping th
e WUT RTM updated is a cr
itical success factor 
because it provides one of the primary mechanis
ms for measuring and ensuring the success of 
the WUT Project.  That is, the mapping of business and functional requirements to use cases 
ensures that these requirements drive the so
ftware engineering e
ffort through design, 
implementation, and testing as a result of the us
e case realization proces
s utilized by the WUT 
Project Development Team.  Once all the use cases
 within the WUT Use Case Model have been 
implemented, then all the busine
ss and functional requir
ements have been satisfied and the WUT 
Project will have completed successfully. 
3.3
 
Use Case Model and Use Cases 
The use case model primarily sets the functional 
requirements on the system, and is used as an 
essential input to analysis and ar
chitectural design.  In essence, 
the use case model and use cases 
are a contract between the project development t
eam and the stakeholders with regards to the 
functionality of the system.  The 
initial release of the model in the inception phase is used to 
outline the scope of the system.  The use case model is refined by more detailed flows of events 
during the elaboration and cons
truction phases.  The use case model is continuously kept 
consistent with the design model. 
 
The use case model consists of use case packages.  A use case package is a collection of use 
cases, actors, relationships, diagrams, and other p
ackages.  It is used to structure the model by 
dividing it into smaller parts.  The WUT Us
e Case Model consists of two packages: 
•
 
Maintain Water Use Tracking Information
 
•
 
View Water Use Permit Information
 
 
The functionality of a system is defined by use case
s, each of which represen
ts a specific flow of 
events.  The description of a use case defines wh
at happens in the system
 when the use case is 
performed.  All functional requiremen
ts must be able to be linked to at least one use case.  This 
ensures all required functionality is being included in the system to be built.  Use cases contain 
several key items: 
•
 
Business Context – A description of 
the business need of the use case. 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
11
•
 
Pre-Conditions – A list of any conditions that
 must be met before the use case can be 
executed. 
•
 
Flow of Events – The sequence of events that
 can take place during the execution of the use 
case.  This includes the Primary Flow, or basi
c path, Alternate Flows,
 Warning Flows, and 
Exception Flows. 
•
 
Post-Conditions – A list of conditions that can
 be expected after the use cases ends, 
dependent on the flow of events executed. 
•
 
Special Requirements – A list of any special requir
ements for a particular use case.  This is a 
“catch-all” section where any information regarding a use case can be captured and stored. 
 
The users and any other system that may interact 
with the system are the actors.  Because they 
represent system users, actors help delimit the system and give a clearer picture of what it is 
supposed to do.  Use cases are developed on the basis 
of the actors' needs.  This ensures that the 
system will turn out to be what the users expected.
 
 
Also included in the use case model are the use case diagrams.  These diagrams illustrate the use 
cases and the actors and the interaction between
 the two.  Use case diagrams can also be 
organized by use case packages to show only what
 is relevant within a particular package. 
 
The WUT Use Case Model was created and is cu
rrently stored in the Enterprise Architect 
modeling tool.  The model includes all requirements 
gathered to-date for the project.  The model 
also has all use cases that will
 be developed for the WUT Syst
em.  All requirements are linked 
within the model to one or more 
use cases.  All the actors identified for the project are also in the 
model.  The use case diagrams show the inte
raction between the actors and the use cases. 
3.4
 
Supplementary Specification 
In contrast to business and 
functional requirements, non-func
tional requirements are system 
requirements that cannot be readily traced to spec
ific use cases within 
the Use Case Model but 
are nonetheless critical to the overa
ll success of the software projec
t.  In general, there are two 
types of non-functional requirements, qualitative 
and general systems.  The first type of non-
functional requirements are actual
ly constraints upon the various 
functions, tasks, or behaviors 
that constitute the system’s business and f
unctional requirements and are, thus, commonly 
considered to be the qualitative aspe
cts of the proposed software system. 
 
Qualitative systems requirements include considerations like: 
•
 
Usability 
•
 
Reliability 
•
 
Performance 
•
 
Supportability 
•
 
Performance Measures 
 
The other type of non-functional requirements is
 general systems require
ments typical to most 
software engineering projects.  No specific ge
neral systems requirements were gathered during 
the requirement workshops for the WUT Project.  
However, these topics will be covered in the 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project – 
February 13, 2007 
Software Requirements Specification 
 
 
12
Software Architecture Document created during th
e Elaboration Phase of the project.  General 
systems requirements include
 considerations like: 
•
 
Security 
•
 
Relational Database Management System 
•
 
Backup and Recovery and Disaster Recovery 
•
 
User Documentation and Training 
 
Because non-functional requirements cannot be traced
 to specific use case
s within the use case 
model or, in some cases like security, apply to 
all use cases within the use case model, these 
requirements are typically not documented in th
e Requirements Traceabil
ity Matrix.  Rather, 
non-functional requirements 
are documented and managed
 
through a separate deliverable called 
a Supplementary Specification. 
 
The purpose of the WUT Supplementary Specifi
cation is to document and manage the non-
functional requirements, or the 
qualitative and general systems re
quirements that are not mapped 
to a specific use cases within the WUT Use Ca
se Model.  These requirements were collected 
during the Requirement Workshops held during the Inception Phase of the project.  This 
Supplementary Specification will be managed and 
iteratively refined as
 appropriate throughout 
the life of the WUT Project. 
 
The Supplementary Specification will be a valuab
le aid to all members of the WUT Project 
Development Team.  This specification will be 
used as a communication medium between the 
development team and the Project Stakeholders
 with regards to both 
qualitative and general 
systems requirements.  The Development Team itself will use the supplementary specification as 
a reference when designing res
ponsibilities, operations, 
and attributes on cla
sses within the WUT 
Design Model, and when adjusting the classes wi
thin the model to the proposed implementation 
environment.  Finally, the supplementary specific
ation will be used to verify compliance of the 
non-functional requirements during th
e testing of the WUT software.

WUT Requirements 
4.1
 
WUT Requirements Traceability Matrix 
The current version of the WUT RTM 
is organized into two sections: 
•
 
Requirements for the Initial 
Release of the WUT System 
•
 
Requirements Identified for a Possible S
ubsequent Release of the WUT System 
 
The first section identifies the 
set of business and functional re
quirements that will be supported 
in the initial release of
 the WUT System and the second sectio
n is comprised of the balance of 
the requirements that will be prioritized by the 
WUT Project Manager for a 
subsequent release of 
system.  Within each section, the requirements ar
e organized into a number of features, each of 
which is a logically related se
t of requirements.  Within each feature, the requirements are 
documented and managed within a matrix or table comprised of the following columns: 
 
•
 
Req ID
 – A unique identifier for each requirement

Minimum Flows and Levels 
Req ID 
Requirement Statement 
Use Case 
EW6 
Need a protocol to asse
ss how the actual flow and 
levels (AFL) compare to the established minimum 
flows and levels (MFL), in
cluding general trending 
information and whether waterbody-specific criteria 
are being met.  There are 
3 major provisions to track: 
•
 
Minimum aquifer level - The saltwater intrusion 
MFL is met when the moving 10-year AFL is at or 
above the MFL for five consecutive years. The 
MFL is not met when the 10-year moving AFL in 
the reference wells is below the MFL for two 
consecutive years. 
•
 
Minimum flows on the upper Peace River - The 
MFL is met when the MFL's are at or above the 
established MFL for three consecutive years. Once 
the MFL has been considered met, if it is followed 
by two years where the MFL is not met within a 
rolling ten-year period, then the AFL shall be 
considered below the MFL.  A determination of 
whether AFL's are meeting the established MFL is 
made at each one of the established minimums 
(Bartow, Ft. Meade and Zolfo Springs). 
•
 
Minimum lake levels - The proposed MFL is 
achieved when the long-term P50 is at or above 
the MFL and the long-term P10 is at or above the 
High Minimum Lake Level for five consecutive 
years. Once in compliance, MFL is not met when 
the long-term P50 is below the MFL for two or 
more consecutive years or the long-term P10 is 
below the High Minimum Lake Levels for two or 
more consecutive years.

such as time period, use types, withdrawal
 type (groundwater or surfacewater), and 
geographic areas.  Once the in
itial query is complete, you need to be able to refine 
the resulting data set.  An example is
 when you select active permits in a time

The following sections will describe the 
various components of a use case model. 
4.2.1
 
Actors 
Over forty actors, with very specific job duties,
 were identified for the WUT System during a use 
case workshop.  All these actors were consolidat
ed into more general categories.  Since a 
majority of the WUT System is reporting in natu
re, all the actors will have the ability to run 
reports, view maps, and query water use permits  
(i.e., General WUT User).  Only a few of the 
features within the system involve the editing of 
data used by the system.  These features will 
only be available to a select few users (i.e., WU
T Administrator, Water Use Estimator).  Figure 1 
shows all the actors that were 
identified during the wo
rkshops, the general categories of these 
actors, as well as three non-human actors (i.e
., Data Integration Syst
em, Oracle Read Only 
Database, Regulatory Database).

4.2.2
 
Use Cases 
Identifying use cases in a use case model is only 
the critical first step.  The business processes 
identified by each use case in the use case mode
l must be described in detail in a narrative 
document.  This narrative describes the behaviors 
the resulting software system must be designed 
to support.  However, following th
e iterative nature of RUP, not 
all use cases are fully completed 
during the initial phase of the proj
ect.  A selection of critical a
nd architecturally significant use 
cases were identified to be completed during the 
initial phase of the pr
oject.  Figure 2 below 
shows the Use Case diagram illustrating all the use 
cases identified to-date for the WUT Project.

Although not all use cases will be fully realized
 during the initial release of the system, a 
Business Context has been created for every us
e case shown in the diagram in Figure 2.  The 
following sections contain 
these business contexts. 
4.2.2.1
 
Process WUT System Startup 
This use case will be used when an actor 
needs to access the Water Use Tracking (WUT) 
System, a browser-based, distributed 3-tier c
lient/server application initially deployed on 
SWFWMD’s Intranet.  To access th
e WUT System, the actor will re
quest the browser to display 
the WUT System Startup Page.  This startup 
page will display information (e.g., WUT System 
News) as well as provide access to the various
 features supported by the WUT System (e.g., 
View Water Use Permit information, performing sp
atial analysis using Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) maps, or running a report).   
 
The information and features available to the act
or will be controlled through the WUT System 
role-based security and WUT System Roles and 
their associated privileges.  When the actor 
initially requests access, the WUT System will dete
rmine the actor’s role and this will, in turn, 
determine the features available to the actor.  
Any actor not explicitly assigned to a WUT System 
Access Criteria role (i.e., WU
T Admin User, WUT Manager User) 
will, by default, be assigned 
to the WUT System General User Role.  This gene
ral role will be allowe
d to access all features 
that are not restricted to
 a specific WUT user role. 
4.2.2.2
 
Generate Well Package 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to generate a well package file for import into 
Groundwater Vistas to model the impact of well/w
ithdrawal changes.  The well package is a 
comma-delimited file that contains many attrib
utes, including location information, regarding 
water withdrawal wells within the 
District.  The well package is used
 as input into in the creation 
of the District-wide Regulatory Model, as 
well as in the creation of regional models. 
4.2.2.3
 
Maintain Business Rule Parameters 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to update business rule parameters within the 
WUT System.  Generally, these parameters are us
ed in making specific calculations within the 
system.  For example, information in the SWUCA II rules explicitly defines how a Lapsed 
Quantity or Water Withdrawal Credits are calculated.  Any parameter that could be used in a 
calculation could be maintained usin
g this use case.  It is important
 to note that these parameters 
will not be used to change the original information stored in the database, but would be used to 
create "derived" data to be show
n within reports or on the screen. 
4.2.2.4
 
Maintain Quick Links 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to manage the quick links located on the WUT 
Home Page.  These are links to other websites 
that could be helpful to a WUT user.  For 
example, a link to other water district's website
s to possibly view water use permit information 
could helpful.  If a permit is requested near the 
boundary of the District, th
e ability to view data 
from the adjacent District would be helpful in determining the impacts of the new permit.

4.2.2.5
 
Maintain Water Use Estimates 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to maintain water use estimation values for water 
use permits.  The permitted quantity is known for 
all water use permits.  However, the actual 
pumpage is only known for those permittees that s
ubmit their data.  For those permits that do not 
submit pumpage data, their water use is estimated, 
based on the data that is submitted from other 
wells.  Currently, the water use estimates are stor
ed in Excel spreadsheets and SAS datasets.  
Currently, this data can only be viewed in summarized form in the Water Use Estimates 
document published annually.  This use case will
 allow the actor to import water use estimate 
data for each water use permit into a database ta
ble that can be used by the WUT System.  This 
will allow users of the system to view pumpage da
ta, as an estimated value, even for permittees 
that do not submit their pumpage information. 
4.2.2.6
 
Maintain WUT News 
This use case is used when the actor needs to maintain WUT news items for communication to 
users when they access the WUT Home Page.  For 
example, the system administrator may need 
to inform WUT users that the system will be 
down for maintenance over the weekend.  Using 
this feature, the system administrator can crea
te a system maintenance news item for display 
starting and ending on specified date
s.  Displaying news on the WU
T Home Page ensures that all 
users will have access to this important informa
tion when they first access the application.   
4.2.2.7
 
Process Database Replication 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to replicate and normalize (restructure) data that 
has been copied directly from
 a DB2 database on the IBM mainframe to a read-only Oracle 
database.  The current data structure was implemen
ted to support a data entry system and not for 
the use in a decision support report
ing system.  The data is being 
restructured to take advantage 
of the strengths of a relational database manageme
nt system.  After the initial replication of the 
DB2 tables, nightly updates are made to the Oracle
 tables with the data that has changed since 
the previous replication 
process.  By normalizing the data into relational tables, it will allow the 
data to be more accessible using ad-hoc query tools. 
4.2.2.8
 
View Change in Use Type or Owner 
This use case will be used when an actor need
s to view information about the relocation of 
permitted quantities associated with a specific water 
use permit.  When an application is made to 
relocate permitted quantities and change the use 
type or owner of an existing permitted quantity 
that impacts an MFL waterbody that is below its 
minimum level, the application is subject to 
certain criteria.  The previously permitted qua
ntity is first reviewed under the reasonable 
beneficial use test.  The quantit
y available for the new owner or new use type is limited to 90 
percent of the permitted historically used portion of the reasonable-beneficial quantity, not 
including any Drought Credit quantities.  This 10 
percent reduction in historically used permitted 
reasonable-beneficial quantity impacting the 
MFL waterbodies const
itutes a Net Benefit. 
 
If any reasonable beneficial, historically unus
ed quantities will remain on the source permit, 
these quantities are also reduced by the Net Bene
fit provision (i.e., 10 perc
ent) and are available 
only for the existing use type at 
the source permit site.  If any r

View Compliance Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view Compliance data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  Depending on the data submitted by the permittee, compliance data 
could include pumpage quantities, meter readings
, crop reports, well construction specifications, 
and any other condition data associated with
 a water use permit.  Providing compliance 
information will give District staff time-saving 
devices with which they can better monitor the 
enforcement activities of the District, with mini
mal impact to staff time.  Better access to those 
who are not submitting pumpage information will 
help evaluators better determine the site 
conditions while evaluating the impacts of
 new applications in the same area. 
4.2.2.10
 
View Crop Report Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view crop report data associated with a 
specific permit.  Crop report data is collected 
on an annual or semi-annual basis and is submitted 
by the permittee.  A different form is submitted for recreational use, annual crops, and seasonal 
crops.  It contains the crop or use type, acreage
 for each use, predominate soil type, and planting 
dates.  The data submitted with crop reports, in 
many cases, is not audited for accuracy, and is 
often incomplete or inaccurate.  The primary purpos
es of this form are to verify the actual soil 
type for the location so that more accurate wa
ter allocations can be made, link the actual ground 
conditions to the use information in the data
base, and monitor the us
e of water conserving 
credits. 
4.2.2.11
 
View Land Use Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to
 view land use data associated with a specific 
water use permit.  Possible scenarios include view
ing trends for specified areas or determining 
how water use changed as land use changes.   
 
Land use data can be collected during permit s
ubmittal or as conditions set on a permit, as well 
as from map analysis.  Permittees will supply land
 use information as water use code types or 
from crop reports submitted for certain WUPs.  
Map analysis is conducted from the land use

4.2.2.12
 
View Lapsed or Project Quantities Summary 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view lapsed or project quantities data 
associated with a specific water use permit.  With the implementation of the new SWUCA rules, 
this process will allow the actor to track these quantities. 
 
Most of the land within the SWUCA is associated 
with an existing water use permit.  Over time, 
permits are reduced, abandoned due to land use ch
anges or abandonment of an activity, retired 
due to acquisition of land for preservation purposes
, or by other means.  Historically, this permit 
activity has resulted in an overall
 reduction in water use.  Now,
 however, these lapsed quantities 
will be available for new and expanding water users to meet their needs.  Another way for a 
water use permit applicant to get water that meets 
their needs is by the use of quantities that are 
associated with District projects. 
4.2.2.13
 
View Map 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view water use permit (WUP) information 
spatially using a map created with the functionality provided by a Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS).  Viewing WUP information in a pr
e-defined report format can be very effective 
from the point of view of effici
ency, organization, and the presenta
tion of large amounts of data.  
Even so, a report is simply a one-dimensional pres
entation of information when that information 
has at its basis a spatial contex
t.  When viewing WUP informati
on in a report, the subtlety and 
complexity of the spatial relati
onships cannot be presented at a
ll or is, at best, difficult to 
comprehend.   The viewing of information within 
its spatial context is exactly where GIS excels 
and is the primary reason for this View Map Use 
Case.  When additional GIS layers are added to 
a map, the multi-dimensional presentation of information provides for a richness of analysis 
simply not possible using a report format. 
 
Although not intended exclusively for this actor, one
 of the primary actors who will use this use 
case is the WUP Evaluators.  They are responsible
 for the analysis of all new, modified, and 
renewed WUPs.  During the analysis process, th
e evaluator will frequently require access to a 
map to view WUP data within its spatial context.
  Doing so will enable the evaluator to view 
other important data within the area of interest 
resulting in a far richer analytical effort.  By 
having the ability to add different GIS layers
 to the map, the evaluator will have more 
information at their disposal to assist in their an
alytical effort.  Add to this the capability to pan, 
zoom, and print at any time, the evaluator will ha
ve all the information and functionality required 
to make better, more informed decisions. 
4.2.2.14
 
View Mitigation of MFL Impacts 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view information of how a specific water use 
permit has mitigated its impact on a MFL waterbody.  When an applicant demonstrates 
compliance with all conditions for issuance, ex
cept that it impacts a minimum flow or level 
waterbody, the applicant can apply for a permit if 
they provide a Net Benefit to the impacted 
MFL waterbody.  This mitigation strategy could 
include the proposition of a water resource

development project that more than negates thei
r proposed impact or it could be the purchasing 
of adjacent land with water us
e permits for their own use. 
 
The following information will be displayed 
to show the mitigation of MFL impacts: 
•
 
The permits and their quantities that we
re bought out to mitigate the MFL impact 
•
 
The District’s projects and their quantit
ies used to mitigate the MFL impact 
•
 
The self-funded projects and their quanti

4.2.2.15
 
View Net Benefit Summary 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to analyze Net Benefit data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  With the implementati
on of the new SWUCA rules, this process will 
allow the actor to track the Net Benefits.  
A Net Benefit is obtained when the proposed 
withdrawal, coupled with other activities or meas
ures, will result in an improvement to the MFL 
waterbody that more than offsets the impact of
 the withdrawal.  In 
all Net Benefit options, 
reasonable beneficial use play
s a key part.  Permits are gr
anted based upon meeting numerous 
rule criteria including that th
e quantities requested are fully n
eeded for the proposed use, or 
existing use in case of a renewal. 
 
The applicant for a new permit or for a modificati
on or renewal of an existing permit is required 
to file detailed information to demonstrate and justify to the reasonable satisfaction of the 
District the reasonable beneficial
 quantities intended to be used 
during the term of the proposed 
permit before it will be issued.  This requirement is
 intended to assist the 
District in seeking to 
reduce the difference between permitted quantities a
nd used quantities.  For those cases in which 
an applicant is seeking a modifica
tion or renewal of an existing perm
it, the District will consider 
historical use, metered pumping data, trends and 
patterns of usage, actual type of usage, and 
other relevant factors. 
 
A Net Benefit can be obtained 
in several ways including: 
•
 
Relocation with a change 
in use type or owner 
•
 
Water withdrawal credits 
•
 
Mitigation of minimum flow and level impacts 
 
There are several ways that the 
District is going to gain water 
with the new SWUCA rules, from 
reclaimed water lines, lapsed qua
ntities, water withdrawal cred
its, and the relocations rules. 
4.2.2.16
 
View Report 
This use case will be used when an actor need
s to produce a report from within the WUT Report 
Library.  It is anticipated that the WUT System 
will have a large number of reports available in 
its report library.  Every report use case within 
the WUT Report Library 
will extend this use case 
as appropriate for the specific report. 
 
A report in this library provides information in
 a pre-defined format.  While the information 
content of the report is pre-defined, the system enhances the flexibility of the report by providing 
the actor with the capability to optionally limit th
e information in any given report to the actor’s 


 
 
 
 
 
Water Use Tracking Project –

33
specific area of interest (e.g., a specific 
county).  This is a
ccomplished through report 
specifications.  While a given report may be r
un frequently, the information content will often 
vary from report to report based upon the run-tim
e report specifications given by the actor.  
 
This use case provides support fo
r the numerous reports within 
the WUT Report Library.  Once 
the actor specifies the report of interest and optionally supplies any run-time report criteria, the 
system will retrieve the information for the actor 
and present it in the pre-defined format.  The 
actor can then choose to simply view the repo
rt online or download the report for analysis, 
printing, or saving as an 
electronic file in a variety of supported formats. 
4.2.2.17
 
View Resource Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to
 view water resource data associated with a 
specific water use permit.  The water resource 
data is collected by the permittee, and varies 
depending on the requirements of the permit includ
ing water quality data, water flows and levels, 
total dissolved mineral levels
 (TDML), and rainfall amounts. 
4.2.2.18
 
View Use of Lapsed Quantities 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to
 view the use of lapsed quantities associated 
with a specific water use permit. Historicall
y, reduced, abandoned, and 
retired permits have 
resulted in an overall reduction in water use. 
 But now, these quantities 
will be a primary means 
for many new or expanding water users to meet th
eir needs.  Where an applicant demonstrates 
compliance with all conditions for issuance, 
except that it impacts an MFL waterbody, the 
applicant can apply for up to 90% of the water it ha
s identified as historically used by a water use 
permit holder that has permanently discontinue
d their use and abandoned their permit.  The 
applicant must also demonstrate that other Ne
t Benefit options, including relocation, mitigation, 
participation in a District Source Augmentation 
Project, are not feasible.  This Net Benefit 
provision applies only when th
e previous water use was derived from a source where the 
permanently discontinued use had a similar or gr
eater effect on the impacted MFL waterbody as 
the proposed use. 
 
One of the main goals of the WUT System is to 
track changes in permitted
 and used quantities so 
that historically used, reasona
ble beneficial quantities poten
tially available from reduced, 
abandoned, or retired permits and their relation 
to MFL waterbodies wi
ll be known for potential 
applicants and for District decision making.  Qu
antities of water retired from land acquisition 
programs are included for use as lapsed quant
ities unless the acquiring agency specifically 
requests for them to be excluded from use.  
 
The following information will be displayed pert
aining to lapsed quantiti
es associated with 
reduced, abandoned, and retired permits: 
•
 
The quantities a retired WUP ha
s contributed to another WUP 
•
 
The quantities a WUP has received from a retired WUP 
•
 
The retired WUP that a lapsed quantity came from

View Use of Quantities Associated With District Projects 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to
 view the quantities used from District Source 
Augmentation Projects associated with a sp
ecific water use permit.  Where applicants 
demonstrate compliance with all conditions 
for issuance except that it impacts an MFL 
waterbody, the applicant can apply for the sour
ce augmentation accomplished through a District 
water resource development project
, provided that the source of s
upply is the same source being 
augmented. 
4.2.2.20
 
View Water Use Permit 
This use case will be used when an actor needs 
to view information about a specific water use 
permit.  This water use permit information is collected at the time the permit is submitted and 
approved by the District.  A water use perm
it is required from the District when:  
 
•
 
Total capacity of the permit is greater than or equal to 1 million gallons per day 
•
 
Total annual average quantities fo
r the permit is greater than 
or equal to 100,000 gallons per 
day 
•
 
Well diameter is greater than or equal to 6 inches 
•
 
Surface water withdrawal pipe
 diameters are greater than or equal to 4 inches 
•
 
Cumulative well diameters greater than or equal 
to 6 inches, if in MI
A and constructed after 
April 11, 1994, and is not a replacement well of same or smaller diameter of one being 
plugged 
•
 
If withdrawal is likely to cause significant ad
verse impacts to existing water or land uses, or 
the surrounding water resources 
 
The actual area of the permit is 
digitized as a polygon into a GI
S layer based on color infrared 
(CIR) digital orthopho
to quarter quadrangles (DOQQs).  The ge
neral data that is collected with 
the permit includes the permittee information, acreage amounts, permitted quantities, water use 
information, expiration date, and aquifer information.  This information will be displayed to the 
actor, with the option to "drill-dow
n" to get more detailed information, such as well information 
or actual pumpage quantities. 
4.2.2.21
 
View Water Use Permit Search 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to search for and identify a water use permit for 
analysis.  This use case, as we
ll as the View Map Use Case, is
 considered among the class of 
Find use cases.  A Find use case provides the 
capability to identif
y, locate, and access 
information within the WUT System, as it pertains
 to a water use permit.  The View Water Use 
Permit Search use case enables the actor to effi
ciently and effectively search for and identify 
permits that meet a given search criteria.  The 
system returns basic info
rmation about the permit 
with the ability to get more detailed informati
on regarding the permit (i.e., wells, Net Benefits, 
compliance data).  This use case is used in 
support of the View Water Use Permit Use Case.

4.2.2.22
 
View Water Withdrawal Credit 
This use case will be used when an actor needs 
to view water withdrawal credit information 
associated with a specific water use permit.  A 
water withdrawal credit is an incentive for an 
applicant to provide other water 
use permit holders with
 alternative supplies.
  The holder of the 
credits can use them to provide a Net Benefit in
 order to obtain water from an MFL waterbody 
because the overall impact will be an impr
ovement.  The applicant (Supplier) provides an 
alternative supply to offset actu
al withdrawals from an existin
g permit holder (Receiver).  The 
credit is 50% of the offset amount.  The discon
tinued quantities are placed in a standby permit 
and are given back to the Receiver in the event 
the Supplier ever stops 
providing the alternative 
source, essentially giving the Recei
ver their original quantity back. 
 
The following information will be displayed pert
aining to the water withdrawal credits for a 
WUP: 
•
 
The offset quantity coming from an alternative source 
•
 
Where the alternative source coming from 
•
 
The Supplier of the alternative source 
•
 
The Receiver of the alternative source 
•

4.2.2.23
 
View Well Construction Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view well construction information that is 
associated with a specific water use permit.  Well construction information is gathered during the 
construction and permitting of the wells.  This 
information includes well depth, casing depth, 
well diameter, status code, drilling method, and 
completion date.  When a well also requires a 
Water Use Permit, some of this information is entered in both the Well Construction database 
and the Water Use Permit Well database.  The tw
o tables are loosely linked.  When the Water 
Use Permit and well number are entered into the 
Well Construction database, a link is created to 
that permit in the Water Use Permit Well database.  The actual information in the table is not 
updated, but another page of well constructi
on information (well construction number, 
completion date, diameter, total and case depth, a
nd well status) is available to view, but only on 
the specified revision.  The well completion info
rmation in the Well Construction database is 
considered to supersede the WUP Well informa
tion, which can contain es
timated data.  Depth 
information is important in determining what 
aquifer a well is pumping water from so the 
drawdown impacts for new water us
e can be calculated accurately. 
4.2.2.24
 
View Withdrawal Pumpage Information 
This use case will be used when an actor needs to view withdrawal pumpage information 
associated with a specific water use permit.  Pu
mpage data is collected at certain wells and 
estimated for others based on several categories of
 water and land use.  Most pumpage data is 
collected on a monthly basis, either through a 
permittee submittal or a utility company meter 
reading.  Based on these actual values, other we
lls that are not metered can be estimated.  
Permittees submit their readings by mail, e-mail, or
 the Internet.  The older permits are required
