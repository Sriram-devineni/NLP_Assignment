   Sentence: Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them.
   Suggestions:
     === AI-POWERED SUGGESTION (Gemini) ===
     1.  **IMPROVED:** Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must automatically record all audited event data into the audit trail.

   Suggestions:
     === AI-POWERED SUGGESTION (Gemini) ===
     1.  **IMPROVED:** The System shall provide an intuitive interface for authorized external personnel with minimal system familiarity to retrieve and inspect audit trail data. This interface must enable the identification of specific events and the comprehensive accessibility of all data related to such events, upon request.
